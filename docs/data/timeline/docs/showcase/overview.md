# Overview

<p class="description">The File Explorer component lets users navigate hierarchical lists of data with nested levels that can be expanded and collapsed.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

## Available components

The MUIÂ X File Explorer package exposes two different versions of the component:

### File Explorer Basic

```jsx
import { Timeline } from '@stoked-ui/timeline/Timeline';
```

The simple version of the File Explorer component receives its items as JSX children.
This is the recommended version for hardcoded items.
