# Overview

<p class="description">The File Explorer component lets users navigate hierarchical lists of data with nested levels that can be expanded and collapsed.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

## Timeline with label column

```jsx
import { Timeline, TimelineState } from '@stoked-ui/timeline';
```

The simple version of the File Explorer component receives its items as JSX children.
This is the recommended version for hardcoded items.
