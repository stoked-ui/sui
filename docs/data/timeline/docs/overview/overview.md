# Overview

<p class="description">The Timeline component provides users a track for each action they want to manipulate controls to easily adjust them.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

## Timeline

```jsx
import { Timeline } from '@stoked-ui/timeline/Timeline';
```

The Timeline component receives its actions either from input props or files that can be dragged and dropped onto the control itself.
