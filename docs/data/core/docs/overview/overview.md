# Overview

<p class="description">The Video Editor component lets users navigate hierarchical lists of data with nested levels that can be expanded and collapsed.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader"}}

## Available components

The StokedÂ UI Core package exposes two different versions of the component:

### Editor

```jsx
import { Editor } from '@stoked-ui/core/Button';
```

The simple version of the File Explorer component receives its items as JSX children.
This is the recommended version for hardcoded items.

{{"demo": "Demo.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false, "bg": "noMargin"}}
