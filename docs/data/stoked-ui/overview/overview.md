# Overview

<p class="description">Stoked UI's goal is to provide a collection of advanced React UI components for complex use cases. Built exactly the same way as MUI Core the experience will be familiar.</p>

## Introduction

Stoked UI 's initial release consists of the File Explorer component. It was created from the [MUI X Tree View](https://mui.com/x/react-tree-view/) component and has Atlassian's [Pragmatic Drag and Drop library](https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop) built in.
