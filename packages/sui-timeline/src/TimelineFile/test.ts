CHAPTER 1
THE JUNGLE
Children are like jam: all very well in the proper place, but you can't stand them all over the
shop--eh, what?'
These were the dreadful words of our Indian uncle. They made us feel very young and angry;
and yet we could not be comforted by calling him names to ourselves, as you do when nasty
grown-ups say nasty things, because he is not nasty, but quite the exact opposite when not
irritated. And we could not think it ungentlemanly of him to say we were like jam, because, as
Alice says, jam is very nice indeed--only not on furniture and improper places like that. My father
said, 'Perhaps they had better go to boarding-school.' And that was awful, because we know
Father disapproves of boarding-schools. And he looked at us and said, 'I am ashamed of them,
sir!'
Your lot is indeed a dark and terrible one when your father is ashamed of you. And we all knew
this, so that we felt in our chests just as if we had swallowed a hard-boiled egg whole. At least,
this is what Oswald felt, and Father said once that Oswald, as the eldest, was the
 1 / 153

representative of the family, so, of course, the others felt the same.
And then everybody said nothing for a short time. At last Father said--
'You may go--but remember--'
The words that followed I am not going to tell you. It is no use telling you what you know
before--as they do in schools. And you must all have had such words said to you many times.
We went away when it was over. The girls cried, and we boys got out books and began to read,
so that nobody should think we cared. But we felt it deeply in our interior hearts, especially
Oswald, who is the eldest and the representative of the family.
We felt it all the more because we had not really meant to do anything wrong. We only thought
perhaps the grown-ups would not be quite pleased if they knew, and that is quite different.
Besides, we meant to put all the things back in their proper places when we had done with them
before anyone found out about it. But I must not anticipate (that means telling the end of the
story before the beginning. I tell you this because it is so sickening to have words you don't
know in a story, and to be told to look it up in the dicker).
We are the Bastables--Oswald, Dora, Dicky, Alice, Noel, and H. O. If you want to know why we
call our youngest brother H. O. you can jolly well read The Treasure Seekers and find out. We
were the Treasure Seekers, and we sought it high and low, and quite regularly, because we
particularly wanted to find it. And at last we did not find it, but we were found by a good, kind
Indian uncle, who helped Father with his business, so that Father was able to take us all to live
in a jolly big red house on Blackheath, instead of in the Lewisham Road, where we lived when
we were only poor but honest Treasure Seekers. When we were poor but honest we always
used to think that if only Father had plenty of business, and we did not have to go short of
pocket money and wear shabby clothes (I don't mind this myself, but the girls do), we should be
happy and very, very good.
And when we were taken to the beautiful big Blackheath house we thought now all would be
well, because it was a house with vineries and pineries, and gas and water, and shrubberies
and stabling, and replete with every modern convenience, like it says in Dyer & Hilton's list of
Eligible House Property. I read all about it, and I have copied the words quite right.
It is a beautiful house, all the furniture solid and strong, no casters off the chairs, and the tables
not scratched, and the silver not dented; and lots of servants, and the most decent meals every
day--and lots of pocket-money.
But it is wonderful how soon you get used to things, even the things you want most. Our
watches, for instance. We wanted them frightfully; but when I had mine a week or two, after the
mainspring got broken and was repaired at Bennett's in the village, I hardly cared to look at the
works at all, and it did not make me feel happy in my heart any more, though, of course, I
should have been very unhappy if it had been taken away from me. And the same with new
clothes and nice dinners and having enough of everything. You soon get used to it all, and it
does not make you extra happy, although, if you had it all taken away, you would be very
dejected. (That is a good word, and one I have never used before.) You get used to everything,
as I said, and then you want something more. Father says this is what people mean by the
deceitfulness of riches; but Albert's uncle says it is the spirit of progress, and Mrs Leslie said

some people called it 'divine discontent'. Oswald asked them all what they thought one Sunday
at dinner. Uncle said it was rot, and what we wanted was bread and water and a licking; but he
meant it for a joke. This was in the Easter holidays.
We went to live at the Red House at Christmas. After the holidays the girls went to the
Blackheath High School, and we boys went to the Prop. (that means the Proprietary School).
And we had to swot rather during term; but about Easter we knew the deceitfulness of riches in
the vac., when there was nothing much on, like pantomimes and things. Then there was the
summer term, and we swotted more than ever; and it was boiling hot, and masters' tempers got
short and sharp, and the girls used to wish the exams came in cold weather. I can't think why
they don't. But I suppose schools don't think of sensible thinks like that. They teach botany at
girls' schools.
Then the Midsummer holidays came, and we breathed again--but only for a few days. We
began to feel as if we had forgotten something, and did not know what it was. We wanted
something to happen--only we didn't exactly know what. So we were very pleased when Father
said--
'I've asked Mr Foulkes to send his children here for a week or two. You know--the kids who
came at Christmas. You must be jolly to them, and see that they have a good time, don't you
know.'
We remembered them right enough--they were little pinky, frightened things, like white mice,
with very bright eyes. They had not been to our house since Christmas, because Denis, the
boy, had been ill, and they had been with an aunt at Ramsgate.
Alice and Dora would have liked to get the bedrooms ready for the honoured guests, but a really
good housemaid is sometimes more ready to say 'Don't' than even a general. So the girls had to
chuck it. Jane only let them put flowers in the pots on the visitors' mantelpieces, and then they
had to ask the gardener which kind they might pick, because nothing worth gathering happened
to be growing in our own gardens just then.
Their train got in at 12.27. We all went to meet them. Afterwards I thought that was a mistake,
because their aunt was with them, and she wore black with beady things and a tight bonnet,
and she said, when we took our hats off-- 'Who are you?' quite crossly.
We said, 'We are the Bastables; we've come to meet Daisy and Denny.'
The aunt is a very rude lady, and it made us sorry for Daisy and Denny when she said to them--
'Are these the children? Do you remember them?' We weren't very tidy, perhaps, because we'd
been playing brigands in the shrubbery; and we knew we should have to wash for dinner as
soon as we got back, anyhow. But still--
Denny said he thought he remembered us. But Daisy said, 'Of course they are,' and then looked
as if she was going to cry.
So then the aunt called a cab, and told the man where to drive, and put Daisy and Denny in,
and then she said--
 3 / 153

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
'You two little girls may go too, if you like, but you little boys must walk.'
So the cab went off, and we were left. The aunt turned to us to say a few last words. We knew it
would have been about brushing your hair and wearing gloves, so Oswald said, 'Good-bye', and
turned haughtily away, before she could begin, and so did the others. No one but that kind of
black beady tight lady would say 'little boys'. She is like Miss Murdstone in David Copperfield. I
should like to tell her so; but she would not understand. I don't suppose she has ever read
anything but Markham's History and Mangnall's Questions--improving books like that.
When we got home we found all four of those who had ridden in the cab sitting in our sittingroom--we don't call it nursery now--looking very thoroughly washed, and our girls were asking
polite questions and the others were saying 'Yes' and 'No', and 'I don't know'. We boys did not
say anything. We stood at the window and looked out till the gong went for our dinner. We felt it
was going to be awful--and it was. The newcomers would never have done for knight-errants, or
to carry the Cardinal's sealed message through the heart of France on a horse; they would
never have thought of anything to say to throw the enemy off the scent when they got into a
tight place.
They said 'Yes, please', and 'No, thank you'; and they ate very neatly, and always wiped their
mouths before they drank, as well as after, and never spoke with them full.
And after dinner it got worse and worse.
We got out all our books and they said 'Thank you', and didn't look at them properly. And we got
out all our toys, and they said 'Thank you, it's very nice' to everything. And it got less and less
pleasant, and towards teatime it came to nobody saying anything except Noel and H. O.--and
they talked to each other about cricket.
After tea Father came in, and he played 'Letters' with them and the girls, and it was a little
better; but while late dinner was going on--I shall never forget it. Oswald felt like the hero of a
book--'almost at the end of his resources'. I don't think I was ever glad of bedtime before, but
that time I was.
When they had gone to bed (Daisy had to have all her strings and buttons undone for her, Dora
told me, though she is nearly ten, and Denny said he couldn't sleep without the gas being left a
little bit on) we held a council in the girls' room. We all sat on the bed--it is a mahogany
fourposter with green curtains very good for tents, only the housekeeper doesn't allow it, and
Oswald said--
'This is jolly nice, isn't it?'
'They'll be better to-morrow,' Alice said, 'they're only shy.'
Dicky said shy was all very well, but you needn't behave like a perfect idiot.
'They're frightened. You see we're all strange to them,' Dora said.
'We're not wild beasts or Indians; we shan't eat them. What have they got to be frightened of?'
Dicky said this.

Noel told us he thought they were an enchanted prince and princess who'd been turned into
white rabbits, and their bodies had got changed back but not their insides.
But Oswald told him to dry up.
'It's no use making things up about them,' he said. 'The thing is: what are we going to DO? We
can't have our holidays spoiled by these snivelling kids.'
'No,' Alice said, 'but they can't possibly go on snivelling for ever. Perhaps they've got into the
habit of it with that Murdstone aunt. She's enough to make anyone snivel.'
'All the same,' said Oswald, 'we jolly well aren't going to have another day like today. We must
do something to rouse them from their snivelling leth--what's its name?--something sudden
and--what is it?--decisive.'
'A booby trap,' said H. O., 'the first thing when they get up, and an apple-pie bed at night.'
But Dora would not hear of it, and I own she was right.
'Suppose,' she said, 'we could get up a good play-- like we did when we were Treasure
Seekers.'
We said, well what? But she did not say.
'It ought to be a good long thing--to last all day,' Dicky said, 'and if they like they can play, and if
they don't--'
'If they don't, I'll read to them,' Alice said.
But we all said 'No, you don't--if you begin that way you'll have to go on.'
And Dicky added, 'I wasn't going to say that at all. I was going to say if they didn't like it they
could jolly well do the other thing.'
We all agreed that we must think of something, but we none of us could, and at last the council
broke up in confusion because Mrs Blake--she is the housekeeper--came up and turned off the
gas.
But next morning when we were having breakfast, and the two strangers were sitting there so
pink and clean, Oswald suddenly said--
'I know; we'll have a jungle in the garden.'
And the others agreed, and we talked about it till brek was over. The little strangers only said 'I
don't know' whenever we said anything to them.
After brekker Oswald beckoned his brothers and sisters mysteriously apart and said--
'Do you agree to let me be captain today, because I thought of it?'

And they said they would.
Then he said, 'We'll play Jungle Book, and I shall be Mowgli. The rest of you can be what you
like--Mowgli's father and mother, or any of the beasts.'
'I don't suppose they know the book,' said Noel. 'They don't look as if they read anything, except
at lesson times.'
'Then they can go on being beasts all the time,' Oswald said. 'Anyone can be a beast.'
So it was settled.
And now Oswald--Albert's uncle has sometimes said he is clever at arranging things--began to
lay his plans for the jungle. The day was indeed well chosen. Our Indian uncle was away;
Father was away; Mrs Blake was going away, and the housemaid had an afternoon off.
Oswald's first conscious act was to get rid of the white mice--I mean the little good visitors. He
explained to them that there would be a play in the afternoon, and they could be what they liked,
and gave them the Jungle Book to read the stories he told them to--all the ones about Mowgli.
He led the strangers to a secluded spot among the sea-kale pots in the kitchen garden and left
them. Then he went back to the others, and we had a jolly morning under the cedar talking
about what we would do when Blakie was gone. She went just after our dinner.
When we asked Denny what he would like to be in the play, it turned out he had not read the
stories Oswald told him at all, but only the 'White Seal' and 'Rikki Tikki'.
We then agreed to make the jungle first and dress up for our parts afterwards. Oswald was a
little uncomfortable about leaving the strangers alone all the morning, so he said Denny should
be his aide-de-camp, and he was really quite useful. He is rather handy with his fingers, and
things that he does up do not come untied. Daisy might have come too, but she wanted to go on
reading, so we let her, which is the truest manners to a visitor. Of course the shrubbery was to
be the jungle, and the lawn under the cedar a forest glade, and then we began to collect the
things. The cedar lawn is just nicely out of the way of the windows. It was a jolly hot day--the
kind of day when the sunshine is white and the shadows are dark grey, not black like they are in
the evening.
We all thought of different things. Of course first we dressed up pillows in the skins of beasts
and set them about on the grass to look as natural as we could. And then we got Pincher, and
rubbed him all over with powdered slate-pencil, to make him the right colour for Grey Brother.
But he shook it all off, and it had taken an awful time to do. Then Alice said--
'Oh, I know!' and she ran off to Father's dressing-room, and came back with the tube of creme
d'amande pour la barbe et les mains, and we squeezed it on Pincher and rubbed it in, and then
the slate-pencil stuff stuck all right, and he rolled in the dust-bin of his own accord, which made
him just the right colour. He is a very clever dog, but soon after he went off and we did not find
him till quite late in the afternoon. Denny helped with Pincher, and with the wild-beast skins, and
when Pincher was finished he said--
'Please, may I make some paper birds to put in the trees? I know how.'

And of course we said 'Yes', and he only had red ink and newspapers, and quickly he made
quite a lot of large paper birds with red tails. They didn't look half bad on the edge of the
shrubbery.
While he was doing this he suddenly said, or rather screamed, 'Oh?'
And we looked, and it was a creature with great horns and a fur rug--something like a bull and
something like a minotaur--and I don't wonder Denny was frightened. It was Alice, and it was
first-class.
Up to now all was not yet lost beyond recall. It was the stuffed fox that did the mischief--and I
am sorry to own it was Oswald who thought of it. He is not ashamed of having THOUGHT of it.
That was rather clever of him. But he knows now that it is better not to take other people's foxes
and things without asking, even if you live in the same house with them.
It was Oswald who undid the back of the glass case in the hall and got out the fox with the
green and grey duck in its mouth, and when the others saw how awfully like life they looked on
the lawn, they all rushed off to fetch the other stuffed things. Uncle has a tremendous lot of
stuffed things. He shot most of them himself--but not the fox, of course. There was another fox's
mask, too, and we hung that in a bush to look as if the fox was peeping out. And the stuffed
birds we fastened on to the trees with string. The duck-bill--what's its name?--looked very well
sitting on his tail with the otter snarling at him. Then Dicky had an idea; and though not nearly
so much was said about it afterwards as there was about the stuffed things, I think myself it was
just as bad, though it was a good idea, too. He just got the hose and put the end over a branch
of the cedar-tree. Then we got the steps they clean windows with, and let the hose rest on the
top of the steps and run. It was to be a waterfall, but it ran between the steps and was only wet
and messy; so we got Father's mackintosh and uncle's and covered the steps with them, so that
the water ran down all right and was glorious, and it ran away in a stream across the grass
where we had dug a little channel for it--and the otter and the duck-bill-thing were as if in their
native haunts. I hope all this is not very dull to read about. I know it was jolly good fun to do.
Taking one thing with another, I don't know that we ever had a better time while it lasted.
We got all the rabbits out of the hutches and put pink paper tails on to them, and hunted them
with horns made out of The Times. They got away somehow, and before they were caught next
day they had eaten a good many lettuces and other things. Oswald is very sorry for this. He
rather likes the gardener.
Denny wanted to put paper tails on the guinea-pigs, and it was no use our telling him there was
nothing to tie the paper on to. He thought we were kidding until we showed him, and then he
said, 'Well, never mind', and got the girls to give him bits of the blue stuff left over from their
dressing-gowns.
'I'll make them sashes to tie round their little middles,' he said. And he did, and the bows stuck
up on the tops of their backs. One of the guinea-pigs was never seen again, and the same with
the tortoise when we had done his shell with vermilion paint. He crawled away and returned no
more. Perhaps someone collected him and thought he was an expensive kind unknown in these
cold latitudes.
The lawn under the cedar was transformed into a dream of beauty, what with the stuffed

creatures and the paper-tailed things and the waterfall. And Alice said--
'I wish the tigers did not look so flat.' For of course with pillows you can only pretend it is a
sleeping tiger getting ready to make a spring out at you. It is difficult to prop up tiger-skins in a
life-like manner when there are no bones inside them, only pillows and sofa cushions.
'What about the beer-stands?' I said. And we got two out of the cellar. With bolsters and string
we fastened insides to the tigers--and they were really fine. The legs of the beer-stands did for
tigers' legs. It was indeed the finishing touch.
Then we boys put on just our bathing drawers and vests--so as to be able to play with the
waterfall without hurting our clothes. I think this was thoughtful. The girls only tucked up their
frocks and took their shoes and stockings off. H. O. painted his legs and his hands with Condy's
fluid--to make him brown, so that he might be Mowgli, although Oswald was captain and had
plainly said he was going to be Mowgli himself. Of course the others weren't going to stand that.
So Oswald said--
'Very well. Nobody asked you to brown yourself like that. But now you've done it, you've simply
got to go and be a beaver, and live in the dam under the waterfall till it washes off.'
He said he didn't want to be beavers. And Noel said--
'Don't make him. Let him be the bronze statue in the palace gardens that the fountain plays out
of.'
So we let him have the hose and hold it up over his head. It made a lovely fountain, only he
remained brown. So then Dicky and Oswald and I did ourselves brown too, and dried H. O. as
well as we could with our handkerchiefs, because he was just beginning to snivel. The brown
did not come off any of us for days.
Oswald was to be Mowgli, and we were just beginning to arrange the different parts. The rest of
the hose that was on the ground was Kaa, the Rock Python, and Pincher was Grey Brother,
only we couldn't find him. And while most of us were talking, Dicky and Noel got messing about
with the beer-stand tigers.
And then a really sad event instantly occurred, which was not really our fault, and we did not
mean to.
That Daisy girl had been mooning indoors all the afternoon with the Jungle Books, and now she
came suddenly out, just as Dicky and Noel had got under the tigers and were shoving them
along to fright each other. Of course, this is not in the Mowgli book at all: but they did look jolly
like real tigers, and I am very far from wishing to blame the girl, though she little knew what
would be the awful consequence of her rash act. But for her we might have got out of it all much
better than we did. What happened was truly horrid.
As soon as Daisy saw the tigers she stopped short, and uttering a shriek like a railway whistle
she fell flat on the ground.
'Fear not, gentle Indian maid,' Oswald cried, thinking with surprise that perhaps after all she did
 8 / 153

know how to play, 'I myself will protect thee.' And he sprang forward with the native bow and
arrows out of uncle's study.
The gentle Indian maiden did not move.
'Come hither,' Dora said, 'let us take refuge in yonder covert while this good knight does battle
for us.' Dora might have remembered that we were savages, but she did not. And that is Dora
all over. And still the Daisy girl did not move.
Then we were truly frightened. Dora and Alice lifted her up, and her mouth was a horrid violetcolour and her eyes half shut. She looked horrid. Not at all like fair fainting damsels, who are
always of an interesting pallor. She was green, like a cheap oyster on a stall.
We did what we could, a prey to alarm as we were. We rubbed her hands and let the hose play
gently but perseveringly on her unconscious brow. The girls loosened her dress, though it was
only the kind that comes down straight without a waist. And we were all doing what we could as
hard as we could, when we heard the click of the front gate. There was no mistake about it.
'I hope whoever it is will go straight to the front door,' said Alice. But whoever it was did not.
There were feet on the gravel, and there was the uncle's voice, saying in his hearty manner--
'This way. This way. On such a day as this we shall find our young barbarians all at play
somewhere about the grounds.'
And then, without further warning, the uncle, three other gentlemen and two ladies burst upon
the scene.
We had no clothes on to speak of--I mean us boys. We were all wet through. Daisy was in a
faint or a fit, or dead, none of us then knew which. And all the stuffed animals were there staring
the uncle in the face. Most of them had got a sprinkling, and the otter and the duck-bill brute
were simply soaked. And three of us were dark brown. Concealment, as so often happens, was
impossible.
The quick brain of Oswald saw, in a flash, exactly how it would strike the uncle, and his brave
young blood ran cold in his veins. His heart stood still.
'What's all this--eh, what?' said the tones of the wronged uncle.
Oswald spoke up and said it was jungles we were playing, and he didn't know what was up with
Daisy. He explained as well as anyone could, but words were now in vain.
The uncle had a Malacca cane in his hand, and we were but ill prepared to meet the sudden
attack. Oswald and H. O. caught it worst. The other boys were under the tigers--and of course
my uncle would not strike a girl. Denny was a visitor and so got off.
But it was bread and water for us for the next three days, and our own rooms. I will not tell you
how we sought to vary the monotonousness of imprisonment. Oswald thought of taming a
mouse, but he could not find one. The reason of the wretched captives might have given way
but for the gutter that you can crawl along from our room to the girls'. But I will not dwell on this

because you might try it yourselves, and it really is dangerous. When my father came home we
got the talking to, and we said we were sorry--and we really were--especially about Daisy,
though she had behaved with muffishness, and then it was settled that we were to go into the
country and stay till we had grown into better children.
Albert's uncle was writing a book in the country; we were to go to his house. We were glad of
this--Daisy and Denny too. This we bore nobly. We knew we had deserved it. We were all very
sorry for everything, and we resolved that for the future we WOULD be good.
I am not sure whether we kept this resolution or not. Oswald thinks now that perhaps we made
a mistake in trying so very hard to be good all at once. You should do everything by degrees.
P.S.--It turned out Daisy was not really dead at all. It was only fainting--so like a girl.
N.B.--Pincher was found on the drawing-room sofa.
Appendix.--I have not told you half the things we did for the jungle--for instance, about the
elephants' tusks and the horse-hair sofa-cushions, and uncle's fishing-boots.
CHAPTER 2
THE WOULDBEGOODS
When we were sent down into the country to learn to be good we felt it was rather good
business, because we knew our being sent there was really only to get us out of the way for a
little while, and we knew right enough that it wasn't a punishment, though Mrs Blake said it was,
because we had been punished thoroughly for taking the stuffed animals out and making a
jungle on the lawn with them, and the garden hose. And you cannot be punished twice for the
same offence. This is the English law; at least I think so. And at any rate no one would punish
you three times, and we had had the Malacca cane and the solitary confinement; and the uncle
had kindly explained to us that all ill-feeling between him and us was wiped out entirely by the
bread and water we had endured. And what with the bread and water and being prisoners, and
not being able to tame any mice in our prisons, I quite feel that we had suffered it up thoroughly,
and now we could start fair.
I think myself that descriptions of places are generally dull, but I have sometimes thought that
was because the authors do not tell you what you truly want to know. However, dull or not, here
goes--because you won't understand anything unless I tell you what the place was like.
The Moat House was the one we went to stay at. There has been a house there since Saxon
times. It is a manor, and a manor goes on having a house on it whatever happens. The Moat
House was burnt down once or twice in ancient centuries--I don't remember which--but they
always built a new one, and Cromwell's soldiers smashed it about, but it was patched up again.
It is a very odd house: the front door opens straight into the dining-room, and there are red
curtains and a black-and-white marble floor like a chess-board, and there is a secret staircase,
only it is not secret now--only rather rickety. It is not very big, but there is a watery moat all
round it with a brick bridge that leads to the front door. Then, on the other side of the moat there
is the farm, with barns and oast houses and stables, or things like that. And the other way the
garden lawn goes on till it comes to the churchyard. The churchyard is not divided from the
garden at all except by a little grass bank. In the front of the house there is more garden, and
 10 / 153

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
the big fruit garden is at the back.
The man the house belongs to likes new houses, so he built a big one with conservatories and
a stable with a clock in a turret on the top, and he left the Moat House. And Albert's uncle took
it, and my father was to come down sometimes from Saturday to Monday, and Albert's uncle
was to live with us all the time, and he would be writing a book, and we were not to bother him,
but he would give an eye to us. I hope all this is plain. I have said it as short as I can.
We got down rather late, but there was still light enough to see the big bell hanging at the top of
the house. The rope belonging to it went right down the house, through our bedroom to the
dining-room. H. O. saw the rope and pulled it while he was washing his hands for supper, and
Dicky and I let him, and the bell tolled solemnly. Father shouted to him not to, and we went
down to supper.
But presently there were many feet trampling on the gravel, and Father went out to see. When
he came back he said-- 'The whole village, or half of it, has come up to see why the bell rang.
It's only rung for fire or burglars. Why can't you kids let things alone?'
Albert's uncle said--
'Bed follows supper as the fruit follows the flower. They'll do no more mischief to-night, sir. Tomorrow I will point out a few of the things to be avoided in this bucolic retreat.'
So it was bed directly after supper, and that was why we did not see much that night.
But in the morning we were all up rather early, and we seemed to have awakened in a new
world rich in surprises beyond the dreams of anybody, as it says in the quotation.
We went everywhere we could in the time, but when it was breakfast-time we felt we had not
seen half or a quarter. The room we had breakfast in was exactly like in a story--black oak
panels and china in corner cupboards with glass doors. These doors were locked. There were
green curtains, and honeycomb for breakfast. After brekker my father went back to town, and
Albert's uncle went too, to see publishers. We saw them to the station, and Father gave us a
long list of what we weren't to do. It began with 'Don't pull ropes unless you're quite sure what
will happen at the other end,' and it finished with 'For goodness sake, try to keep out of mischief
till I come down on Saturday'. There were lots of other things in between.
We all promised we would. And we saw them off and waved till the train was quite out of sight.
Then we started to walk home. Daisy was tired so Oswald carried her home on his back. When
we got home she said--
'I do like you, Oswald.'
She is not a bad little kid; and Oswald felt it was his duty to be nice to her because she was a
visitor. Then we looked all over everything. It was a glorious place. You did not know where to
begin. We were all a little tired before we found the hayloft, but we pulled ourselves together to
make a fort with the trusses of hay--great square things--and we were having a jolly good time,
all of us, when suddenly a trap-door opened and a head bobbed up with a straw in its mouth.
We knew nothing about the country then, and the head really did scare us rather, though, of
 11 / 153

course, we found out directly that the feet belonging to it were standing on the bar of the loosebox underneath. The head said--
'Don't you let the governor catch you a-spoiling of that there hay, that's all.' And it spoke thickly
because of the straw.
It is strange to think how ignorant you were in the past. We can hardly believe now that once we
really did not know that it spoiled hay to mess about with it. Horses don't like to eat it afterwards.
Always remember this.
When the head had explained a little more it went away, and we turned the handle of the chaffcutting machine, and nobody got hurt, though the head HAD said we should cut our fingers off if
we touched it.
And then we sat down on the floor, which is dirty with the nice clean dirt that is more than half
chopped hay, and those there was room for hung their legs down out of the top door, and we
looked down at the farmyard, which is very slushy when you get down into it, but most
interesting.
Then Alice said--
'Now we're all here, and the boys are tired enough to sit still for a minute, I want to have a
council.'
We said what about? And she said, 'I'll tell you.' H. O., don't wriggle so; sit on my frock if the
straws tickle your legs.'
You see he wears socks, and so he can never be quite as comfortable as anyone else.
'Promise not to laugh' Alice said, getting very red, and looking at Dora, who got red too.
We did, and then she said:
'Dora and I have talked this over, and Daisy too, and we have written it down because it is
easier than saying it. Shall I read it? or will you, Dora?'
Dora said it didn't matter; Alice might. So Alice read it, and though she gabbled a bit we all
heard it. I copied it afterwards. This is what she read:
NEW SOCIETY FOR BEING GOOD IN
'I, Dora Bastable, and Alice Bastable, my sister, being of sound mind and body, when we were
shut up with bread and water on that jungle day, we thought a great deal about our naughty
sins, and we made our minds up to be good for ever after. And we talked to Daisy about it, and
she had an idea. So we want to start a society for being good in. It is Daisy's idea, but we think
so too.'
'You know,' Dora interrupted, 'when people want to do good things they always make a society.
 12 / 153

There are thousands--there's the Missionary Society.'
'Yes,' Alice said, 'and the Society for the Prevention of something or other, and the Young Men's
Mutual Improvement Society, and the S.P.G.'
'What's S.P.G.?' Oswald asked.
'Society for the Propagation of the Jews, of course,' said Noel, who cannot always spell.
'No, it isn't; but do let me go on.'
Alice did go on.
'We propose to get up a society, with a chairman and a treasurer and secretary, and keep a
journal-book saying what we've done. If that doesn't make us good it won't be my fault.
'The aim of the society is nobleness and goodness, and great and unselfish deeds. We wish not
to be such a nuisance to grown-up people and to perform prodigies of real goodness. We wish
to spread our wings'--here Alice read very fast. She told me afterwards Daisy had helped her
with that part, and she thought when she came to the wings they sounded rather silly--'to spread
our wings and rise above the kind of interesting things that you ought not to do, but to do
kindnesses to all, however low and mean.'
Denny was listening carefully. Now he nodded three or four times.
'Little words of kindness' (he said), 'Little deeds of love,
Make this earth an eagle
Like the one above.'
This did not sound right, but we let it pass, because an eagle does have wings, and we wanted
to hear the rest of what the girls had written. But there was no rest.
'That's all,' said Alice, and Daisy said-- 'Don't you think it's a good idea?'
'That depends,' Oswald answered, 'who is president and what you mean by being good.'
Oswald did not care very much for the idea himself, because being good is not the sort of thing
he thinks it is proper to talk about, especially before strangers. But the girls and Denny seemed
to like it, so Oswald did not say exactly what he thought, especially as it was Daisy's idea. This
was true politeness.
'I think it would be nice,' Noel said, 'if we made it a sort of play. Let's do the Pilgrim's Progress.'
We talked about that for some time, but it did not come to anything, because we all wanted to
be Mr Greatheart, except H. O., who wanted to be the lions, and you could not have lions in a
Society for Goodness.
Dicky said he did not wish to play if it meant reading books about children who die; he really felt
just as Oswald did about it, he told me afterwards. But the girls were looking as if they were in
 13 / 153

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
Sunday school, and we did not wish to be unkind.
At last Oswald said, 'Well, let's draw up the rules of the society, and choose the president and
settle the name.'
Dora said Oswald should be president, and he modestly consented. She was secretary, and
Denny treasurer if we ever had any money.
Making the rules took us all the afternoon. They were these:
RULES
1. Every member is to be as good as possible.
2. There is to be no more jaw than necessary about being good. (Oswald and Dicky put that rule
in.)
3. No day must pass without our doing some kind action to a suffering fellow-creature.
4. We are to meet every day, or as often as we like.
5. We are to do good to people we don't like as often as we can.
6. No one is to leave the Society without the consent of all the rest of us.
7. The Society is to be kept a profound secret from all the world except us.
8. The name of our Society is--
And when we got as far as that we all began to talk at once. Dora wanted it called the Society
for Humane Improvement; Denny said the Society for Reformed Outcast Children; but Dicky
said, No, we really were not so bad as all that.
Then H. O. said, 'Call it the Good Society.'
'Or the Society for Being Good In,' said Daisy.
'Or the Society of Goods,' said Noel.
'That's priggish,' said Oswald; 'besides, we don't know whether we shall be so very.'
'You see,' Alice explained, 'we only said if we COULD we would be good.'
'Well, then,' Dicky said, getting up and beginning to dust the chopped hay off himself, 'call it the
Society of the Wouldbegoods and have done with it.'
Oswald thinks Dicky was getting sick of it and wanted to make himself a little disagreeable. If so,
he was doomed to disappointment. For everyone else clapped hands and called out, 'That's the
very thing!' Then the girls went off to write out the rules, and took H. O. with them, and Noel

went to write some poetry to put in the minute book. That's what you call the book that a
society's secretary writes what it does in. Denny went with him to help. He knows a lot of poetry.
I think he went to a lady's school where they taught nothing but that. He was rather shy of us,
but he took to Noel. I can't think why. Dicky and Oswald walked round the garden and told each
other what they thought of the new society.
'I'm not sure we oughtn't to have put our foot down at the beginning,' Dicky said. 'I don't see
much in it, anyhow.'
'It pleases the girls,' Oswald said, for he is a kind brother.
'But we're not going to stand jaw, and "words in season", and "loving sisterly warnings". I tell
you what it is, Oswald, we'll have to run this thing our way, or it'll be jolly beastly for everybody.'
Oswald saw this plainly.
'We must do something,' Dicky said; it's very very hard, though. Still, there must be SOME
interesting things that are not wrong.'
'I suppose so,' Oswald said, 'but being good is so much like being a muff, generally. Anyhow I'm
not going to smooth the pillows of the sick, or read to the aged poor, or any rot out of Ministering
Children.'
'No more am I,' Dicky said. He was chewing a straw like the head had in its mouth, 'but I
suppose we must play the game fair. Let's begin by looking out for something useful to
do--something like mending things or cleaning them, not just showing off.'
'The boys in books chop kindling wood and save their pennies to buy tea and tracts.'
'Little beasts!' said Dick. 'I say, let's talk about something else.' And Oswald was glad to, for he
was beginning to feel jolly uncomfortable.
We were all rather quiet at tea, and afterwards Oswald played draughts with Daisy and the
others yawned. I don't know when we've had such a gloomy evening. And everyone was
horribly polite, and said 'Please' and 'Thank you' far more than requisite.
Albert's uncle came home after tea. He was jolly, and told us stories, but he noticed us being a
little dull, and asked what blight had fallen on our young lives. Oswald could have answered and
said, 'It is the Society of the Wouldbegoods that is the blight,' but of course he didn't and Albert's
uncle said no more, but he went up and kissed the girls when they were in bed, and asked them
if there was anything wrong. And they told him no, on their honour.
The next morning Oswald awoke early. The refreshing beams of the morning sun shone on his
narrow white bed and on the sleeping forms of his dear little brothers and Denny, who had got
the pillow on top of his head and was snoring like a kettle when it sings. Oswald could not
remember at first what was the matter with him, and then he remembered the Wouldbegoods,
and wished he hadn't. He felt at first as if there was nothing you could do, and even hesitated to
buzz a pillow at Denny's head. But he soon saw that this could not be. So he chucked his boot
and caught Denny right in the waistcoat part, and thus the day began more brightly than he had

expected.
Oswald had not done anything out of the way good the night before, except that when no one
was looking he polished the brass candlestick in the girls' bedroom with one of his socks. And
he might just as well have let it alone, for the servants cleaned it again with the other things in
the morning, and he could never find the sock afterwards. There were two servants. One of
them had to be called Mrs Pettigrew instead of Jane and Eliza like others. She was cook and
managed things.
After breakfast Albert's uncle said--
'I now seek the retirement of my study. At your peril violate my privacy before 1.30 sharp.
Nothing short of bloodshed will warrant the intrusion, and nothing short of man--or rather
boy--slaughter shall avenge it.'
So we knew he wanted to be quiet, and the girls decided that we ought to play out of doors so
as not to disturb him; we should have played out of doors anyhow on a jolly fine day like that.
But as we were going out Dicky said to Oswald--
'I say, come along here a minute, will you?'
So Oswald came along, and Dicky took him into the other parlour and shut the door, and
Oswald said--
'Well, spit it out: what is it?' He knows that is vulgar, and he would not have said it to anyone but
his own brother. Dicky said--
'It's a pretty fair nuisance. I told you how it would be.' And Oswald was patient with him, and
said--
'What is? Don't be all day about it.'
Dicky fidgeted about a bit, and then he said--
'Well, I did as I said. I looked about for something useful to do. And you know that dairy window
that wouldn't open--only a little bit like that? Well, I mended the catch with wire and whip cord
and it opened wide.'
'And I suppose they didn't want it mended,' said Oswald. He knew but too well that grown-up
people sometimes like to keep things far different from what we would, and you catch it if you try
to do otherwise.
'I shouldn't have minded THAT,' Dicky said, 'because I could easily have taken it all off again if
they'd only said so. But the sillies went and propped up a milk-pan against the window. They
never took the trouble to notice I had mended it. So the wretched thing pushed the window open
all by itself directly they propped it up, and it tumbled through into the moat, and they are most
awfully waxy. All the men are out in the fields and they haven't any spare milk-pans. If I were a
farmer, I must say I wouldn't stick at an extra milk-pan or two. Accidents must happen

sometimes. I call it mean.'
Dicky spoke in savage tones. But Oswald was not so unhappy, first because it wasn't his fault,
and next because he is a far-seeing boy.
'Never mind,' he said kindly. 'Keep your tail up. We'll get the beastly milk-pan out all right. Come
on.' He rushed hastily to the garden and gave a low, signifying whistle, which the others know
well enough to mean something extra being up.
And when they were all gathered round him he spoke.
'Fellow countrymen,' he said, 'we're going to have a rousing good time.'
'It's nothing naughty, is it,' Daisy asked, 'like the last time you had that was rousingly good?'
Alice said 'Shish', and Oswald pretended not to hear.
'A precious treasure,' he said, 'has inadvertently been laid low in the moat by one of us.'
'The rotten thing tumbled in by itself,' Dicky said.
Oswald waved his hand and said, 'Anyhow, it's there. It's our duty to restore it to its sorrowing
owners. I say, look here--we're going to drag the moat.'
Everyone brightened up at this. It was our duty and it was interesting too. This is very
uncommon.
So we went out to where the orchard is, at the other side of the moat. There were gooseberries
and things on the bushes, but we did not take any till we had asked if we might. Alice went and
asked. Mrs Pettigrew said, 'Law! I suppose so; you'd eat 'em anyhow, leave or no leave.'
She little knows the honourable nature of the house of Bastable. But she has much to learn.
The orchard slopes gently down to the dark waters of the moat. We sat there in the sun and
talked about dragging the moat, till Denny said, 'How DO you drag moats?'
And we were speechless, because, though we had read many times about a moat being
dragged for missing heirs and lost wills, we really had never thought about exactly how it was
done.
'Grappling-irons are right, I believe,' Denny said, 'but I don't suppose they'd have any at the
farm.'
And we asked, and found they had never even heard of them. I think myself he meant some
other word, but he was quite positive.
So then we got a sheet off Oswald's bed, and we all took our shoes and stockings off, and we
tried to see if the sheet would drag the bottom of the moat, which is shallow at that end. But it
It was long and narrowish and bony, and with great yellow teeth sticking in the jaw.
Bill came back just then and said it was a horse's head, but H. O. and Noel would not believe it,
and Oswald owns that no horse he has ever seen had a head at all that shape.
But Oswald did not stop to argue, because he saw a keeper who showed me how to set snares
going by, and he wanted to talk to him about ferrets, so he went off and Dicky and Denny and
Alice with him. Also Daisy and Dora went off to finish reading Ministering Children. So H. O. and
Noel were left with the bony head. They took it away.

The incident had quite faded from the mind of Oswald next day. But just before breakfast Noel
and H. O. came in, looking hot and anxious. They had got up early and had not washed at
all--not even their hands and faces. Noel made Oswald a secret signal. All the others saw it, and
with proper delicate feeling pretended not to have.
When Oswald had gone out with Noel and H. O. in obedience to the secret signal, Noel said--
'You know that dragon's head yesterday?'
'Well?' Oswald said quickly, but not crossly--the two things are quite different.
'Well, you know what happened in Greek history when some chap sowed dragon's teeth?'
'They came up armed men,' said H. O., but Noel sternly bade him shut up, and Oswald said
'Well,' again. If he spoke impatiently it was because he smelt the bacon being taken in to
breakfast.
'Well,' Noel went on, 'what do you suppose would have come up if we'd sowed those dragon's
teeth we found yesterday?'
'Why, nothing, you young duffer,' said Oswald, who could now smell the coffee. 'All that isn't
History it's Humbug. Come on in to brekker.'
'It's NOT humbug,' H. O. cried, 'it is history. We DID sow--'
'Shut up,' said Noel again. 'Look here, Oswald. We did sow those dragon's teeth in Randall's tenacre meadow, and what do you think has come up?'
'Toadstools I should think,' was Oswald's contemptible rejoinder.
'They have come up a camp of soldiers,' said Noel--ARMED MEN. So you see it WAS history.
We have sowed army-seed, just like Cadmus, and it has come up. It was a very wet night. I
daresay that helped it along.'
Oswald could not decide which to disbelieve--his brother or his ears. So, disguising his doubtful
emotions without a word, he led the way to the bacon and the banqueting hall.
He said nothing about the army-seed then, neither did Noel and H. O. But after the bacon we
went into the garden, and then the good elder brother said--
'Why don't you tell the others your cock-and-bull story?'
So they did, and their story was received with warm expressions of doubt. It was Dicky who
observed--
'Let's go and have a squint at Randall's ten-acre, anyhow. I saw a hare there the other day.'
We went. It is some little way, and as we went, disbelief reigned superb in every breast except
Noel's and H. O.'s, so you will see that even the ready pen of the present author cannot be

expected to describe to you his variable sensations when he got to the top of the hill and
suddenly saw that his little brothers had spoken the truth. I do not mean that they generally tell
lies, but people make mistakes sometimes, and the effect is the same as lies if you believe
them.
There WAS a camp there with real tents and soldiers in grey and red tunics. I daresay the girls
would have said coats. We stood in ambush, too astonished even to think of lying in it, though
of course we know that this is customary. The ambush was the wood on top of the little hill,
between Randall's ten-acre meadow and Sugden's Waste Wake pasture.
'There would be cover here for a couple of regiments,' whispered Oswald, who was, I think,
gifted by Fate with the far-seeingness of a born general.
Alice merely said 'Hist', and we went down to mingle with the troops as though by accident, and
seek for information.
The first man we came to at the edge of the camp was cleaning a sort of cauldron thing like
witches brew bats in.
We went up to him and said, 'Who are you? Are you English, or are you the enemy?'
'We're the enemy,' he said, and he did not seem ashamed of being what he was. And he spoke
English with quite a good accent for a foreigner.
'The enemy!' Oswald echoed in shocked tones. It is a terrible thing to a loyal and patriotic youth
to see an enemy cleaning a pot in an English field, with English sand, and looking as much at
home as if he was in his foreign fastnesses.
The enemy seemed to read Oswald's thoughts with deadly unerringness. He said--
'The English are somewhere over on the other side of the hill. They are trying to keep us out of
Maidstone.'
After this our plan of mingling with the troops did not seem worth going on with. This soldier, in
spite of his unerringness in reading Oswald's innermost heart, seemed not so very sharp in
other things, or he would never have given away his secret plans like this, for he must have
known from our accents that we were Britons to the backbone. Or perhaps (Oswald thought
this, and it made his blood at once boil and freeze, which our uncle had told us was possible,
but only in India), perhaps he thought that Maidstone was already as good as taken and it didn't
matter what he said. While Oswald was debating within his intellect what to say next, and how
to say it so as to discover as many as possible of the enemy's dark secrets, Noel said--
'How did you get here? You weren't here yesterday at tea-time.'
The soldier gave the pot another sandy rub, and said--
'I daresay it does seem quick work--the camp seems as if it had sprung up in the night, doesn't
it?--like a mushroom.'

Alice and Oswald looked at each other, and then at the rest of us. The words 'sprung up in the
night' seemed to touch a string in every heart.
'You see,' whispered Noel, 'he won't tell us how he came here. NOW, is it humbug or history?'
Oswald, after whisperedly requesting his young brother to dry up and not bother, remarked,
'Then you're an invading army?'
'Well,' said the soldier, 'we're a skeleton battalion, as a matter of fact, but we're invading all right
enough.'
And now indeed the blood of the stupidest of us froze, just as the quick-witted Oswald's had
done earlier in the interview. Even H. O. opened his mouth and went the colour of mottled soap;
he is so fat that this is the nearest he can go to turning pale. Denny said, 'But you don't look like
skeletons.'
The soldier stared, then he laughed and said, 'Ah, that's the padding in our tunics. You should
see us in the grey dawn taking our morning bath in a bucket.' It was a dreadful picture for the
imagination. A skeleton, with its bones all loose most likely, bathing anyhow in a pail. There was
a silence while we thought it over.
Now, ever since the cleaning-cauldron soldier had said that about taking Maidstone, Alice had
kept on pulling at Oswald's jacket behind, and he had kept on not taking any notice. But now he
could not stand it any longer, so he said--
'Well, what is it?'
Alice drew him aside, or rather, she pulled at his jacket so that he nearly fell over backwards,
and then she whispered, 'Come along, don't stay parlaying with the foe. He's only talking to you
to gain time.'
'What for?' said Oswald.
'Why, so that we shouldn't warn the other army, you silly,' Alice said, and Oswald was so upset
by what she said, that he forgot to be properly angry with her for the wrong word she used.
'But we ought to warn them at home,' she said--' suppose the Moat House was burned down,
and all the supplies commandeered for the foe?'
Alice turned boldly to the soldier. 'DO you burn down farms?' she asked.
'Well, not as a rule,' he said, and he had the cheek to wink at Oswald, but Oswald would not
look at him. 'We've not burned a farm since--oh, not for years.'
'A farm in Greek history it was, I expect,' Denny murmured. 'Civilized warriors do not burn farms
nowadays,' Alice said sternly, 'whatever they did in Greek times. You ought to know that.'
The soldier said things had changed a good deal since Greek times.

So we said good morning as quickly as we could: it is proper to be polite even to your enemy,
except just at the moments when it has really come to rifles and bayonets or other weapons.
The soldier said 'So long!' in quite a modern voice, and we retraced our footsteps in silence to
the ambush--I mean the wood. Oswald did think of lying in the ambush then, but it was rather
wet, because of the rain the night before, that H. O. said had brought the army-seed up. And
Alice walked very fast, saying nothing but 'Hurry up, can't you!' and dragging H. O. by one hand
and Noel by the other. So we got into the road.
Then Alice faced round and said, 'This is all our fault. If we hadn't sowed those dragon's teeth
there wouldn't have been any invading army.'
I am sorry to say Daisy said, 'Never mind, Alice, dear. WE didn't sow the nasty things, did we,
Dora?'
But Denny told her it was just the same. It was WE had done it, so long as it was any of us,
especially if it got any of us into trouble. Oswald was very pleased to see that the Dentist was
beginning to understand the meaning of true manliness, and about the honour of the house of
Bastable, though of course he is only a Foulkes. Yet it is something to know he does his best to
learn.
If you are very grown-up, or very clever, I daresay you will now have thought of a great many
things. If you have you need not say anything, especially if you're reading this aloud to anybody.
It's no good putting in what you think in this part, because none of us thought anything of the
kind at the time.
We simply stood in the road without any of your clever thoughts, filled with shame and distress
to think of what might happen owing to the dragon's teeth being sown. It was a lesson to us
never to sow seed without being quite sure what sort it is. This is particularly true of the penny
packets, which sometimes do not come up at all, quite unlike dragon's teeth.
Of course H. O. and Noel were more unhappy than the rest of us. This was only fair.
'How can we possibly prevent their getting to Maidstone?' Dickie said. 'Did you notice the red
cuffs on their uniforms? Taken from the bodies of dead English soldiers, I shouldn't wonder.'
'If they're the old Greek kind of dragon's-teeth soldiers, they ought to fight each other to death,'
Noel said; 'at least, if we had a helmet to throw among them.'
But none of us had, and it was decided that it would be of no use for H. O. to go back and throw
his straw hat at them, though he wanted to. Denny said suddenly--
'Couldn't we alter the sign-posts, so that they wouldn't know the way to Maidstone?'
Oswald saw that this was the time for true generalship to be shown.
He said--
'Fetch all the tools out of your chest--Dicky go too, there's a good chap, and don't let him cut his
 136 / 153

legs with the saw.' He did once, tumbling over it. 'Meet us at the cross-roads, you know, where
we had the Benevolent Bar. Courage and dispatch, and look sharp about it.'
When they had gone we hastened to the crossroads, and there a great idea occurred to
Oswald. He used the forces at his command so ably that in a very short time the board in the
field which says 'No thoroughfare. Trespassers will be prosecuted' was set up in the middle of
the road to Maidstone. We put stones, from a heap by the road, behind it to make it stand up.
Then Dicky and Denny came back, and Dicky shinned up the sign-post and sawed off the two
arms, and we nailed them up wrong, so that it said 'To Maidstone' on the Dover Road, and 'To
Dover' on the road to Maidstone. We decided to leave the Trespassers board on the real
Maidstone road, as an extra guard.
Then we settled to start at once to warn Maidstone.
Some of us did not want the girls to go, but it would have been unkind to say so. However, there
was at least one breast that felt a pang of joy when Dora and Daisy gave out that they would
rather stay where they were and tell anybody who came by which was the real road.
'Because it would be so dreadful if someone was going to buy pigs or fetch a doctor or anything
in a hurry and then found they had got to Dover instead of where they wanted to go to,' Dora
said. But when it came to dinner-time they went home, so that they were entirely out of it. This
often happens to them by some strange fatalism.
We left Martha to take care of the two girls, and Lady and Pincher went with us. It was getting
late in the day, but I am bound to remember no one said anything about their dinners, whatever
they may have thought. We cannot always help our thoughts. We happened to know it was
roast rabbits and currant jelly that day.
We walked two and two, and sang the 'British Grenadiers' and 'Soldiers of the queen' so as to
be as much part of the British Army as possible. The Cauldron-Man had said the English were
the other side of the hill. But we could not see any scarlet anywhere, though we looked for it as
carefully as if we had been fierce bulls.
But suddenly we went round a turn in the road and came plump into a lot of soldiers. Only they
were not red-coats. They were dressed in grey and silver. And it was a sort of furzy-common
place, and three roads branching out. The men were lying about, with some of their belts
undone, smoking pipes and cigarettes.
'It's not British soldiers,' Alice said. 'Oh dear, oh dear, I'm afraid it's more enemy. You didn't sow
the army-seed anywhere else, did you, H. O. dear?'
H. O. was positive he hadn't. 'But perhaps lots more came up where we did sow them,' he said;
'they're all over England by now very likely. _I_ don't know how many men can grow out of one
dragon's tooth.'
Then Noel said, 'It was my doing anyhow, and I'm not afraid,' and he walked straight up to the
nearest soldier, who was cleaning his pipe with a piece of grass, and said--

'Please, are you the enemy?' The man said--
'No, young Commander-in-Chief, we're the English.'
Then Oswald took command. 'Where is the General?' he said.
'We're out of generals just now, Field-Marshal,' the man said, and his voice was a gentleman's
voice. 'Not a single one in stock. We might suit you in majors now --and captains are quite
cheap. Competent corporals going for a song. And we have a very nice colonel, too quiet to ride
or drive.'
Oswald does not mind chaff at proper times. But this was not one.
'You seem to be taking it very easy,' he said with disdainful expression.
'This IS an easy,' said the grey soldier, sucking at his pipe to see if it would draw.
'I suppose YOU don't care if the enemy gets into Maidstone or not!' exclaimed Oswald bitterly. 'If
I were a soldier I'd rather die than be beaten.'
The soldier saluted. 'Good old patriotic sentiment' he said, smiling at the heart-felt boy.
But Oswald could bear no more. 'Which is the Colonel?' he asked.
'Over there--near the grey horse.'
'The one lighting a cigarette?' H. O. asked.
'Yes--but I say, kiddie, he won't stand any jaw. There's not an ounce of vice about him, but he's
peppery. He might kick out. You'd better bunk.'
'Better what?' asked H. O.
'Bunk, bottle, scoot, skip, vanish, exit,' said the soldier.
'That's what you'd do when the fighting begins,' said H. O. He is often rude like that--but it was
what we all thought, all the same.
The soldier only laughed.
A spirited but hasty altercation among ourselves in whispers ended in our allowing Alice to be
the one to speak to the Colonel. It was she who wanted to. 'However peppery he is he won't
kick a girl,' she said, and perhaps this was true.
But of course we all went with her. So there were six of us to stand in front of the Colonel. And
as we went along we agreed that we would salute him on the word three. So when we got near,
Dick said, 'One, two, three', and we all saluted very well--except H. O., who chose that minute to
trip over a rifle a soldier had left lying about, and was only saved from falling by a man in a
cocked hat who caught him deftly by the back of his jacket and stood him on his legs.

'Let go, can't you,' said H. O. 'Are you the General?'
Before the Cocked Hat had time to frame a reply, Alice spoke to the Colonel. I knew what she
meant to say, because she had told me as we threaded our way among the resting soldiery.
What she really said was--
'Oh, how CAN you!'
'How can I WHAT?' said the Colonel, rather crossly.
'Why, SMOKE?' said Alice.
'My good children, if you're an infant Band of Hope, let me recommend you to play in some
other backyard,' said the Cock-Hatted Man.
H. O. said, 'Band of Hope yourself'--but no one noticed it.
'We're NOT a Band of Hope,' said Noel. 'We're British, and the man over there told us you are.
And Maidstone's in danger, and the enemy not a mile off, and you stand SMOKING.' Noel was
standing crying, himself, or something very like it.
'It's quite true,' Alice said.
The Colonel said, 'Fiddle-de-dee.'
But the Cocked-Hatted Man said, 'What was the enemy like?' We told him exactly. And even the
Colonel then owned there might be something in it.
'Can you show me the place where they are on the map?' he asked.
'Not on the map, we can't,' said Dicky--'at least, I don't think so, but on the ground we could. We
could take you there in a quarter of an hour.'
The Cocked-Hatted One looked at the Colonel, who returned his scrutiny, then he shrugged his
shoulders.
'Well, we've got to do something,' he said, as if to himself. 'Lead on, Macduff.'
The Colonel roused his soldiery from their stupor of pipes by words of command which the
present author is sorry he can't remember.
Then he bade us boys lead the way. I tell you it felt fine, marching at the head of a regiment.
Alice got a lift on the Cocked-Hatted One's horse. It was a red-roan steed of might, exactly as if
it had been in a ballad. They call a grey-roan a 'blue' in South Africa, the Cocked-Hatted One
said.
We led the British Army by unfrequented lanes till we got to the gate of Sugden's Waste Wake
pasture. Then the Colonel called a whispered halt, and choosing two of us to guide him, the
dauntless and discerning commander went on, on foot, with an orderly. He chose Dicky and
 139 / 153

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
Oswald as guides. So we led him to the ambush, and we went through it as quietly as we could.
But twigs do crackle and snap so when you are reconnoitring, or anxious to escape detection
for whatever reason.
Our Colonel's orderly crackled most. If you're not near enough to tell a colonel by the crown and
stars on his shoulder-strap, you can tell him by the orderly behind him, like 'follow my leader'.
'Look out!' said Oswald in a low but commanding whisper, 'the camp's down in that field. You
can see if you take a squint through this gap.'
The speaker took a squint himself as he spoke, and drew back, baffled beyond the power of
speech. While he was struggling with his baffledness the British Colonel had his squint. He also
drew back, and said a word that he must have known was not right--at least when he was a
boy.
'I don't care,' said Oswald, 'they were there this morning. White tents like mushrooms, and an
enemy cleaning a cauldron.'
'With sand,' said Dicky.
'That's most convincing,' said the Colonel, and I did not like the way he said it.
'I say,' Oswald said, 'let's get to the top corner of the ambush--the wood, I mean. You can see
the crossroads from there.'
We did, and quickly, for the crackling of branches no longer dismayed our almost despairing
spirits.
We came to the edge of the wood, and Oswald's patriotic heart really did give a jump, and he
cried, 'There they are, on the Dover Road.'
Our miscellaneous signboard had done its work.
'By Jove, young un, you're right! And in quarter column, too! We've got em on toast--on
toast--egad!' I never heard anyone not in a book say 'egad' before, so I saw something really
out of the way was indeed up.
The Colonel was a man of prompt and decisive action. He sent the orderly to tell the Major to
advance two companies on the left flank and take cover. Then we led him back through the
wood the nearest way, because he said he must rejoin the main body at once. We found the
main body very friendly with Noel and H. O. and the others, and Alice was talking to the CockedHatted One as if she had known him all her life.
'I think he's a general in disguise,' Noel said. 'He's been giving us chocolate out of a pocket in
his saddle.'
Oswald thought about the roast rabbit then--and he is not ashamed to own it--yet he did not say
a word. But Alice is really not a bad sort. She had saved two bars of chocolate for him and
Dicky. Even in war girls can sometimes be useful in their humble way.

The Colonel fussed about and said, 'Take cover there!' and everybody hid in the ditch, and the
horses and the Cocked Hat, with Alice, retreated down the road out of sight. We were in the
ditch too. It was muddy--but nobody thought of their boots in that perilous moment. It seemed a
long time we were crouching there. Oswald began to feel the water squelching in his boots, so
we held our breath and listened. Oswald laid his ear to the road like a Red Indian. You would
not do this in time of peace, but when your country is in danger you care but little about keeping
your ears clean. His backwoods' strategy was successful. He rose and dusted himself and
said--
'They're coming!'
It was true. The footsteps of the approaching foe were now to be heard quite audibly, even by
ears in their natural position. The wicked enemy approached. They were marching with a
careless swaggeringness that showed how little they suspected the horrible doom which was
about to teach them England's might and supremeness.
Just as the enemy turned the corner so that we could see them, the Colonel shouted--
'Right section, fire!' and there was a deafening banging.
The enemy's officer said something, and then the enemy got confused and tried to get into the
fields through the hedges. But all was vain. There was firing now from our men, on the left as
well as the right. And then our Colonel strode nobly up to the enemy's Colonel and demanded
surrender. He told me so afterwards. His exact words are only known to himself and the other
Colonel. But the enemy's Colonel said, 'I would rather die than surrender,' or words to that
effect.
Our Colonel returned to his men and gave the order to fix bayonets, and even Oswald felt his
manly cheek turn pale at the thought of the amount of blood to be shed. What would have
happened can never now be revealed. For at this moment a man on a piebald horse came
clattering over a hedge--as carelessly as if the air was not full of lead and steel at all. Another
man rode behind him with a lance and a red pennon on it. I think he must have been the
enemy's General coming to tell his men not to throw away their lives on a forlorn hope, for
directly he said they were captured the enemy gave in and owned that they were. The enemy's
Colonel saluted and ordered his men to form quarter column again. I should have thought he
would have had about enough of that myself.
He had now given up all thought of sullen resistance to the bitter end. He rolled a cigarette for
himself, and had the foreign cheek to say to our Colonel--
'By Jove, old man, you got me clean that time! Your scouts seem to have marked us down
uncommonly neatly.'
It was a proud moment when our Colonel laid his military hand on Oswald's shoulder and said--
'This is my chief scout' which were high words, but not undeserved, and Oswald owns he felt
red with gratifying pride when he heard them.
'So you are the traitor, young man,' said the wicked Colonel, going on with his cheek.
Oswald bore it because our Colonel had, and you should be generous to a fallen foe, but it is
 141 / 153

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
hard to be called a traitor when you haven't.
He did not treat the wicked Colonel with silent scorn as he might have done, but he said--
'We aren't traitors. We are the Bastables and one of us is a Foulkes. We only mingled
unsuspected with the enemy's soldiery and learned the secrets of their acts, which is what
Baden-Powell always does when the natives rebel in South Africa; and Denis Foulkes thought
of altering the sign-posts to lead the foe astray. And if we did cause all this fighting, and get
Maidstone threatened with capture and all that, it was only because we didn't believe Greek
things could happen in Great Britain and Ireland, even if you sow dragon's teeth, and besides,
some of us were not as e a out sowing them.'
Then the Cocked-Hatted One led his horse and walked with us and made us tell him all about it,
and so did the Colonel. The wicked Colonel listened too, which was only another proof of his
cheek.
And Oswald told the tale in the modest yet manly way that some people think he has, and gave
the others all the credit they deserved. His narration was interrupted no less than four times by
shouts of 'Bravo!' in which the enemy's Colonel once more showed his cheek by joining. By the
time the story was told we were in sight of another camp. It was the British one this time. The
Colonel asked us to have tea in his tent, and it only shows the magnanimosity of English
chivalry in the field of battle that he asked the enemy's Colonel too. With his usual cheek he
accepted. We were jolly hungry.
When everyone had had as much tea as they possibly could, the Colonel shook hands with us
all, and to Oswald he said--
'Well, good-bye, my brave scout. I must mention your name in my dispatches to the War Office.'
H. O. interrupted him to say, 'His name's Oswald Cecil Bastable, and mine is Horace Octavius.'
I wish H. O. would learn to hold his tongue. No one ever knows Oswald was christened Cecil as
well, if he can possibly help it. YOU didn't know it till now.
'Mr Oswald Bastable,' the Colonel went on--he had the decency not to take any notice of the
'Cecil' -'you would be a credit to any regiment. No doubt the War Office will reward you properly
for what you have done for your country. But meantime, perhaps, you'll accept five shillings from
a grateful comrade-in-arms.' Oswald felt heart-felt sorry to wound the good Colonel's feelings,
but he had to remark that he had only done his duty, and he was sure no British scout would
take five bob for doing that. 'And besides,' he said, with that feeling of justice which is part of his
young character, 'it was the others just as much as me.'
'Your sentiments, Sir,' said the Colonel who was one of the politest and most discerning
colonels I ever saw, 'your sentiments do you honour. But, Bastables all, and--and nonBastables' (he couldn't remember Foulkes; it's not such an interesting name as Bastable, of
course) -'at least you'll accept a soldier's pay?'
'Lucky to touch it, a shilling a day!' Alice and Denny said together. And the Cocked-Hatted Man
said something about knowing your own mind and knowing your own Kipling.
 142 / 153

'A soldier,' said the Colonel, 'would certainly be lucky to touch it. You see there are deductions
for rations. Five shillings is exactly right, deducting twopence each for six teas.'
This seemed cheap for the three cups of tea and the three eggs and all the strawberry jam and
bread-and-butter Oswald had had, as well as what the others ate, and Lady's and Pincher's
teas, but I suppose soldiers get things cheaper than civilians, which is only right.
Oswald took the five shillings then, there being no longer any scruples why he should not.
Just as we had parted from the brave Colonel and the rest we saw a bicycle coming. It was
Albert's uncle. He got off and said--
'What on earth have you been up to? What were you doing with those volunteers?'
We told him the wild adventures of the day, and he listened, and then he said he would
withdraw the word volunteers if we liked.
But the seeds of doubt were sown in the breast of Oswald. He was now almost sure that we had
made jolly fools of ourselves without a moment's pause throughout the whole of this eventful
day. He said nothing at the time, but after supper he had it out with Albert's uncle about the
word which had been withdrawn.
Albert's uncle said, of course, no one could be sure that the dragon's teeth hadn't come up in
the good old-fashioned way, but that, on the other hand, it was barely possible that both the
British and the enemy were only volunteers having a field-day or sham fight, and he rather
thought the Cocked-Hatted Man was not a general, but a doctor. And the man with a red
pennon carried behind him MIGHT have been the umpire.
Oswald never told the others a word of this. Their young breasts were all panting with joy
because they had saved their country; and it would have been but heartless unkindness to
show them how silly they had been. Besides, Oswald felt he was much too old to have been so
taken in--if he HAD been. Besides, Albert's uncle did say that no one could be sure about the
dragon's teeth.
The thing that makes Oswald feel most that, perhaps, the whole thing was a beastly sell, was
that we didn't see any wounded. But he tries not to think of this. And if he goes into the army
when he grows up, he will not go quite green. He has had experience of the arts of war and the
tented field. And a real colonel has called him 'Comrade-in-Arms', which is exactly what Lord
Roberts called his own soldiers when he wrote home about them.
CHAPTER 14
ALBERT'S UNCLE's GRANDMOTHER; OR, THE LONG-LOST
The shadw of the termination now descended in sable thunder-clouds upon our devoted nobs.
As Albert's uncle said, 'School now gaped for its prey'. In a very short space of time we should
be wending our way back to Blackheath, and all the variegated delightfulness of the country
would soon be only preserved in memory's faded flowers. (I don't care for that way of writing
very much. It would be an awful swot to keep it up--looking out the words and all that.)

To speak in the language of everyday life, our holiday was jolly nearly up. We had had a ripping
time, but it was all but over. We really did feel sorry-- though, of course, it was rather decent to
think of getting back to Father and being able to tell the other chaps about our raft, and the dam,
and the Tower of Mystery, and things like that.
When but a brief time was left to us, Oswald and Dicky met by chance in an apple-tree. (That
sounds like 'consequences', but it is mere truthfulness.) Dicky said--
'Only four more days.'
Oswald said, 'Yes.'
'There's one thing,' Dickie said, 'that beastly society. We don't want that swarming all over
everything when we get home. We ought to dissolve it before we leave here.'
The following dialogue now took place:
Oswald--'Right you are. I always said it was piffling rot.'
Dicky--'So did I.'
Oswald--'Let's call a council. But don't forget we've jolly well got to put our foot down.'
Dicky assented, and the dialogue concluded with apples.
The council, when called, was in but low spirits. This made Oswald's and Dicky's task easier.
When people are sunk in gloomy despair about one thing, they will agree to almost anything
about something else. (Remarks like this are called philosophic generalizations, Albert's uncle
says.) Oswald began by saying--
'We've tried the society for being good in, and perhaps it's done us good. But now the time has
come for each of us to be good or bad on his own, without hanging on to the others.'
'The race is run by one and one,
But never by two and two,'
the Dentist said.
The others said nothing.
Oswald went on: 'I move that we chuck--I mean dissolve-- the Wouldbegoods Society; its
appointed task is done. If it's not well done, that's ITS fault and not ours.'
Dicky said, 'Hear! hear! I second this prop.'
The unexpected Dentist said, 'I third it. At first I thought it would help, but afterwards I saw it only
made you want to be naughty, just because you were a Wouldbegood.'
Oswald owns he was surprised. We put it to the vote at once, so as not to let Denny cool. H. O.
 144 / 153

and Noel and Alice voted with us, so Daisy and Dora were what is called a hopeless minority.
We tried to cheer their hopelessness by letting them read the things out of the Golden Deed
book aloud. Noel hid his face in the straw so that we should not see the faces he made while he
made poetry instead of listening, and when the Wouldbegoods was by vote dissolved for ever
he sat up, straws in his hair, and said--
THE EPITAPH
'The Wouldbegoods are dead and gone But not the golden deeds they have done These will
remain upon Glory's page
To be an example to every age,
And by this we have got to know
How to be good upon our ow--N.
N is for Noel, that makes the rhyme and the sense both right. O, W, N, own; do you see?'
We saw it, and said so, and the gentle poet was satisfied. And the council broke up. Oswald felt
that a weight had been lifted from his expanding chest, and it is curious that he never felt so
inclined to be good and a model youth as he did then. As he went down the ladder out of the loft
he said--
'There's one thing we ought to do, though, before we go home. We ought to find Albert's uncle's
long- lost grandmother for him.'
Alice's heart beat true and steadfast. She said, 'That's just exactly what Noel and I were saying
this morning. Look out, Oswald, you wretch, you're kicking chaff into my eyes.' She was going
down the ladder just under me.
Oswald's younger sister's thoughtful remark ended in another council. But not in the straw loft.
We decided to have a quite new place, and disregarded H. O.'s idea of the dairy and Noel's of
the cellars. We had the new council on the secret staircase, and there we settled exactly what
we ought to do. This is the same thing, if you really wish to be good, as what you are going to
do. It was a very interesting council, and when it was over Oswald was so pleased to think that
the Wouldbegoods was unrecoverishly dead that he gave Denny and Noel, who were sitting on
the step below him, a good-humoured, playful, gentle, loving, brotherly shove, and said, 'Get
along down, it's tea-time!'
No reader who understands justice and the real rightness of things, and who is to blame for
what, will ever think it could have been Oswald's fault that the two other boys got along down by
rolling over and over each other, and bursting the door at the bottom of the stairs open by their
revolving bodies. And I should like to know whose fault it was that Mrs Pettigrew was just on the
other side of that door at that very minute? The door burst open, and the Impetuous bodies of
Noel and Denny rolled out of it into Mrs Pettigrew, and upset her and the tea-tray. Both
revolving boys were soaked with tea and milk, and there were one or two cups and things
smashed. Mrs Pettigrew was knocked over, but none of her bones were broken. Noel and
Denny were going to be sent to bed, but Oswald said it was all his fault. He really did this to give
the others a chance of doing a refined golden deed by speaking the truth and saying it was not
his fault. But you cannot really count on anyone. They did not say anything, but only rubbed the
lumps on their late-revolving heads. So it was bed for Oswald, and he felt the injustice hard.
 145 / 153

But he sat up in bed and read The Last of the Mohicans, and then he began to think. When
Oswald really thinks he almost always thinks of something. He thought of something now, and it
was miles better than the idea we had decided on in the secret staircase, of advertising in the
Kentish Mercury and saying if Albert's uncle's long-lost grandmother would call at the Moat
House she might hear of something much to her advantage.
What Oswald thought of was that if we went to Hazelbridge and asked Mr B. Munn, Grocer, that
drove us home in the cart with the horse that liked the wrong end of the whip best, he would
know who the lady was in the red hat and red wheels that paid him to drive us home that
Canterbury night. He must have been paid, of course, for even grocers are not generous
enough to drive perfect strangers, and five of them too, about the country for nothing. Thus we
may learn that even unjustness and sending the wrong people to bed may bear useful fruit,
which ought to be a great comfort to everyone when they are unfairly treated. Only it most likely
won't be. For if Oswald's brothers and sisters had nobly stood by him as he expected, he would
not have had the solitary reflections that led to the great scheme for finding the grandmother.
Of course when the others came up to roost they all came and squatted on Oswald's bed and
said how sorry they were. He waived their apologies with noble dignity, because there wasn't
much time, and said he had an idea that would knock the council's plan into a cocked hat. But
he would not tell them what it was. He made them wait till next morning. This was not sulks, but
kind feeling. He wanted them to have something else to think of besides the way they hadn't
stood by him in the bursting of the secret staircase door and the tea-tray and the milk.
Next morning Oswald kindly explained, and asked who would volunteer for a forced march to
Hazelbridge. The word volunteer cost the young Oswald a pang as soon as he had said it, but I
hope he can bear pangs with any man living. 'And mind,' he added, hiding the pang under a
general-like severeness, 'I won't have anyone in the expedition who has anything in his shoes
except his feet.'
This could not have been put more delicately and decently. But Oswald is often misunderstood.
Even Alice said it was unkind to throw the peas up at Denny. When this little unpleasantness
had passed away (it took some time because Daisy cried, and Dora said, 'There now, Oswald!')
there were seven volunteers, which, with Oswald, made eight, and was, indeed, all of us. There
were no cockle-shells, or tape-sandals, or staves, or scrips, or anything romantic and pious
about the eight persons who set out for Hazelbridge that morning, more earnestly wishful to be
good and deedful--at least Oswald, I know, was--than ever they had been in the days of the
beastly Wouldbegood Society. It was a fine day. Either it was fine nearly all last summer, which
is how Oswald remembers it, or else nearly all the interesting things we did came on fine days.
With hearts light and gay, and no peas in anyone's shoes, the walk to Hazelbridge was
perseveringly conducted. We took our lunch with us, and the dear dogs. Afterwards we wished
for a time that we had left one of them at home. But they did so want to come, all of them, and
Hazelbridge is not nearly as far as Canterbury, really, so even Martha was allowed to put on her
things--I mean her collar--and come with us. She walks slowly, but we had the day before us so
there was no extra hurry.
At Hazelbridge we went into B. Munn's grocer's shop and asked for ginger-beer to drink. They
gave it us, but they seemed surprised at us wanting to drink it there, and the glass was warm--it
had just been washed. We only did it, really, so as to get into conversation with B. Munn,
 146 / 153

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
grocer, and extract information without rousing suspicion. You cannot be too careful. However,
when we had said it was first-class ginger- beer, and paid for it, we found it not so easy to
extract anything more from B. Munn, grocer; and there was an anxious silence while he fiddled
about behind the counter among the tinned meats and sauce bottles, with a fringe of hobnailed
boots hanging over his head.
H. O. spoke suddenly. He is like the sort of person who rushes in where angels fear to tread, as
Denny says (say what sort of person that is). He said--
'I say, you remember driving us home that day. Who paid for the cart?'
Of course B. Munn, grocer, was not such a nincompoop (I like that word, it means so many
people I know) as to say right off. He said--
'I was paid all right, young gentleman. Don't you terrify yourself.'
People in Kent say terrify when they mean worry. So Dora shoved in a gentle oar. She said--
'We want to know the kind lady's name and address, so that we can write and thank her for
being so jolly that day.'
B. Munn, grocer, muttered something about the lady's address being goods he was often asked
for. Alice said, 'But do tell us. We forgot to ask her. She's a relation of a second-hand uncle of
ours, and I do so want to thank her properly. And if you've got any extra-strong peppermints at a
penny an ounce, we should like a quarter of a pound.'
This was a master-stroke. While he was weighing out the peppermints his heart got soft, and
just as he was twisting up the corner of the paper bag, Dora said, 'What lovely fat peppermints!
Do tell us.'
And B. Munn's heart was now quite melted, he said--
'It's Miss Ashleigh, and she lives at The Cedars--about a mile down the Maidstone Road.'
We thanked him, and Alice paid for the peppermints. Oswald was a little anxious when she
ordered such a lot, but she and Noel had got the money all right, and when we were outside on
Hazelbridge Green (a good deal of it is gravel, really), we stood and looked at each other. Then
Dora said--
'Let's go home and write a beautiful letter and all sign it.'
Oswald looked at the others. Writing is all very well, but it's such a beastly long time to wait for
anything to happen afterwards.
The intelligent Alice divined his thoughts, and the Dentist divined hers--he is not clever enough
yet to divine Oswald's--and the two said together--
'Why not go and see her?'
 147 / 153

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
'She did say she would like to see us again some day,' Dora replied. So after we had argued a
little about it we went.
And before we had gone a hundred yards down the dusty road Martha began to make us wish
with all our hearts we had not let her come. She began to limp, just as a pilgrim, who I will not
name, did when he had the split peas in his silly palmering shoes.
So we called a halt and looked at her feet. One of them was quite swollen and red. Bulldogs
almost always have something the matter with their feet, and it always comes on when least
required. They are not the right breed for emergencies.
There was nothing for it but to take it in turns to carry her. She is very stout, and you have no
idea how heavy she is. A half-hearted unadventurous person name no names, but Oswald,
Alice, Noel, H. O., Dicky, Daisy, and Denny will understand me) said, why not go straight home
and come another day without Martha? But the rest agreed with Oswald when he said it was
only a mile, and perhaps we might get a lift home with the poor invalid. Martha was very grateful
to us for our kindness. She put her fat white arms round the person's neck who happened to be
carrying her. She is very affectionate, but by holding her very close to you you can keep her
from kissing your face all the time. As Alice said, 'Bulldogs do give you such large, wet, pink
kisses.'
A mile is a good way when you have to take your turn at carrying Martha.
At last we came to a hedge with a ditch in front of it, and chains swinging from posts to keep
people off the grass and out of the ditch, and a gate with 'The Cedars' on it in gold letters. All
very neat and tidy, and showing plainly that more than one gardener was kept. There we
stopped. Alice put Martha down, grunting with exhaustedness, and said--
'Look here, Dora and Daisy, I don't believe a bit that it's his grandmother. I'm sure Dora was
right, and it's only his horrid sweetheart. I feel it in my bones. Now, don't you really think we'd
better chuck it; we're sure to catch it for interfering. We always do.'
'The cross of true love never did come smooth,' said the Dentist. 'We ought to help him to bear
his cross.'
'But if we find her for him, and she's not his grandmother, he'll MARRY her,' Dicky said in tones
of gloominess and despair.
Oswald felt the same, but he said, 'Never mind. We should all hate it, but perhaps Albert's uncle
MIGHT like it. You can never tell. If you want to do a really unselfish action and no kid, now's
your time, my late Wouldbegoods.'
No one had the face to say right out that they didn't want to be unselfish.
But it was with sad hearts that the unselfish seekers opened the long gate and went up the
gravel drive between the rhododendrons and other shrubberies towards the house.
I think I have explained to you before that the eldest son of anybody is called the representative
of the family if his father isn't there. This was why Oswald now took the lead. When we got to

the last turn of the drive it was settled that the others were to noiselessly ambush in the
rhododendrons, and Oswald was to go on alone and ask at the house for the grandmother from
India--I mean Miss Ashleigh.
So he did, but when he got to the front of the house and saw how neat the flower-beds were
with red geraniums, and the windows all bright and speckless with muslin blinds and brass rods,
and a green parrot in a cage in the porch, and the doorstep newly whited, lying clean and
untrodden in the sunshine, he stood still and thought of his boots and how dusty the roads were,
and wished he had not gone into the farmyard after eggs before starting that morning. As he
stood there in anxious uncertainness he heard a low voice among the bushes. It said, 'Hist!
Oswald here!' and it was the voice of Alice.
So he went back to the others among the shrubs and they all crowded round their leader full of
importable news.
'She's not in the house; she's HERE,' Alice said in a low whisper that seemed nearly all S's.
'Close by--she went by just this minute with a gentleman.'
'And they're sitting on a seat under a tree on a little lawn, and she's got her head on his
shoulder, and he's holding her hand. I never saw anyone look so silly in all my born,' Dicky said.
'It's sickening,' Denny said, trying to look very manly with his legs wide apart.
'I don't know,' Oswald whispered. 'I suppose it wasn't Albert's uncle?'
'Not much,' Dicky briefly replied.
'Then don't you see it's all right. If she's going on like that with this fellow she'll want to marry
him, and Albert's uncle is safe. And we've really done an unselfish action without having to
suffer for it afterwards.'
With a stealthy movement Oswald rubbed his hands as he spoke in real joyfulness. We decided
that we had better bunk unnoticed. But we had reckoned without Martha. She had strolled off
limping to look about her a bit in the shrubbery. 'Where's Martha?' Dora suddenly said.
'She went that way,' pointingly remarked H. O.
'Then fetch her back, you young duffer! What did you let her go for?' Oswald said. 'And look
sharp. Don't make a row.'
He went. A minute later we heard a hoarse squeak from Martha--the one she always gives
when suddenly collared from behind--and a little squeal in a lady-like voice, and a man say
'Hallo!' and then we knew that H. O. had once more rushed in where angels might have thought
twice about it. We hurried to the fatal spot, but it was too late. We were just in time to hear H. O.
say--
'I'm sorry if she frightened you. But we've been looking for you. Are you Albert's uncle's long-lost
grandmother?'

'NO,' said our lady unhesitatingly.
It seemed vain to add seven more agitated actors to the scene now going on. We stood still.
The man was standing up. He was a clergyman, and I found out afterwards he was the nicest
we ever knew except our own Mr Briston at Lewisham, who is now a canon or a dean, or
something grand that no one ever sees. At present I did not like him. He said, 'No, this lady is
nobody's grandmother. May I ask in return how long it is since you escaped from the lunatic
asylum, my poor child, and whence your keeper is?'
H. O. took no notice of this at all, except to say, 'I think you are very rude, and not at all funny, if
you think you are.'
The lady said, 'My dear, I remember you now perfectly. How are all the others, and are you
pilgrims again to-day?'
H. O. does not always answer questions. He turned to the man and said--
'Are you going to marry the lady?'
'Margaret,' said the clergyman, 'I never thought it would come to this: he asks me my intentions.'
'If you ARE,' said H. O., 'it's all right, because if you do Albert's uncle can't--at least, not till
you're dead. And we don't want him to.'
'Flattering, upon my word,' said the clergyman, putting on a deep frown. 'Shall I call him out,
Margaret, for his poor opinion of you, or shall I send for the police?'
Alice now saw that H. O., though firm, was getting muddled and rather scared. She broke cover
and sprang into the middle of the scene.
'Don't let him rag H. O. any more,' she said, 'it's all our faults. You see, Albert's uncle was so
anxious to find you, we thought perhaps you were his long-lost heiress sister or his old nurse
who alone knew the secret of his birth, or something, and we asked him, and he said you were
his long-lost grandmother he had known in India. And we thought that must be a mistake and
that really you were his long-lost sweetheart. And we tried to do a really unselfish act and find
you for him. Because we don't want him to be married at all.'
'It isn't because we don't like YOU,' Oswald cut in, now emerging from the bushes, 'and if he
must marry, we'd sooner it was you than anyone. Really we would.'
'A generous concession, Margaret,' the strange clergyman uttered, 'most generous, but the plot
thickens. It's almost pea-soup-like now. One or two points clamour for explanation. Who are
these visitors of yours? Why this Red Indian method of paying morning calls? Why the lurking
attitude of the rest of the tribe which I now discern among the undergrowth? Won't you ask the
rest of the tribe to come out and join the glad throng?'
Then I liked him better. I always like people who know the same songs we do, and books and
tunes and things.

The others came out. The lady looked very uncomfy, and partly as if she was going to cry. But
she couldn't help laughing too, as more and more of us came out.
'And who,' the clergyman went on, 'who in fortune's name is Albert? And who is his uncle? And
what have they or you to do in this galere--I mean garden?'
We all felt rather silly, and I don't think I ever felt more than then what an awful lot there were of
us.
'Three years' absence in Calcutta or elsewhere may explain my ignorance of these details, but
still--'
'I think we'd better go,' said Dora. 'I'm sorry if we've done anything rude or wrong. We didn't
mean to. Good-bye. I hope you'll be happy with the gentleman, I'm sure.'
'I HOPE so too,' said Noel, and I know he was thinking how much nicer Albert's uncle was. We
turned to go. The lady had been very silent compared with what she was when she pretended
to show us Canterbury. But now she seemed to shake off some dreamy silliness, and caught
hold of Dora by the shoulder.
'No, dear, no,' she said, 'it's all right, and you must have some tea--we'll have it on the lawn.
John, don't tease them any more. Albert's uncle is the gentleman I told you about. And, my dear
children, this is my brother that I haven't seen for three years.'
'Then he's a long-lost too,' said H. O.
The lady said 'Not now' and smiled at him.
And the rest of us were dumb with confounding emotions. Oswald was particularly dumb. He
might have known it was her brother, because in rotten grown-up books if a girl kisses a man in
a shrubbery that is not the man you think she's in love with; it always turns out to be a brother,
though generally the disgrace of the family and not a respectable chaplain from Calcutta.
The lady now turned to her reverend and surprising brother and said, 'John, go and tell them
we'll have tea on the lawn.'
When he was gone she stood quite still a minute. Then she said, 'I'm going to tell you
something, but I want to put you on your honour not to talk about it to other people. You see it
isn't everyone I would tell about it. He, Albert's uncle, I mean, has told me a lot about you, and I
know I can trust you.'
We said 'Yes', Oswald with a brooding sentiment of knowing all too well what was coming next.
The lady then said, 'Though I am not Albert's uncle's grandmother I did know him in India once,
and we were going to be married, but we had a--a--misunderstanding.'
'Quarrel?' Row?' said Noel and H. O. at once.
'Well, yes, a quarrel, and he went away. He was in the Navy then. And then ... well, we were
 151 / 153

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
both sorry, but well, anyway, when his ship came back we'd gone to Constantinople, then to
England, and he couldn't find us. And he says he's been looking for me ever since.'
'Not you for him?' said Noel.
'Well, perhaps,' said the lady.
And the girls said 'Ah!' with deep interest. The lady went on more quickly, 'And then I found you,
and then he found me, and now I must break it to you. Try to bear up.'
She stopped. The branches cracked, and Albert's uncle was in our midst. He took off his hat.
'Excuse my tearing my hair,' he said to the lady, 'but has the pack really hunted you down?'
'It's all right,' she said, and when she looked at him she got miles prettier quite suddenly. 'I was
just breaking to them ...'
'Don't take that proud privilege from me,' he said. 'Kiddies, allow me to present you to the future
Mrs Albert's uncle, or shall we say Albert's new aunt?'
* * *
There was a good deal of explaining done before tea--about how we got there, I mean, and
why. But after the first bitterness of disappointment we felt not nearly so sorry as we had
expected to. For Albert's uncle's lady was very jolly to us, and her brother was awfully decent,
and showed us a lot of first-class native curiosities and things, unpacking them on purpose;
skins of beasts, and beads, and brass things, and shells from different savage lands besides
India. And the lady told the girls that she hoped they would like her as much as she liked them,
and if they wanted a new aunt she would do her best to give satisfaction in the new situation.
And Alice thought of the Murdstone aunt belonging to Daisy and Denny, and how awful it would
have been if Albert's uncle had married HER. And she decided, she told me afterwards, that we
might think ourselves jolly lucky it was no worse.
Then the lady led Oswald aside, pretending to show him the parrot which he had explored
thoroughly before, and told him she was not like some people in books. When she was married
she would never try to separate her husband from his bachelor friends, she only wanted them to
be her friends as well.
Then there was tea, and thus all ended in amicableness, and the reverend and friendly drove us
home in a wagonette. But for Martha we shouldn't have had tea, or explanations, or lift or
anything. So we honoured her, and did not mind her being so heavy and walking up and down
constantly on our laps as we drove home.
And that is all the story of the long-lost grandmother and Albert's uncle. I am afraid it is rather
dull, but it was very important (to him), so I felt it ought to be narrated. Stories about lovers and
getting married are generally slow. I like a love-story where the hero parts with the girl at the
garden-gate in the gloaming and goes off and has adventures, and you don't see her any more
till he comes home to marry her at the end of the book. And I suppose people have to marry.
Albert's uncle is awfully old--more than thirty, and the lady is advanced in years--twenty-six next
Christmas. They are to be married then. The girls are to be bridesmaids in white frocks with fur.
This quite consoles them. If Oswald repines sometimes, he hides it. What's the use? We all
 152 / 153

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
have to meet our fell destiny, and Albert's uncle is not extirpated from this awful law.
Now the finding of the long-lost was the very last thing we did for the sake of its being a noble
act, so that is the end of the Wouldbegoods, and there are no more chapters after this. But
Oswald hates books that finish up without telling you the things you might want to know about
the people in the book. So here goes.
We went home to the beautiful Blackheath house. It seemed very stately and mansion-like after
the Moat House, and everyone was most frightfully pleased to see us.
Mrs Pettigrew CRIED when we went away. I never was so astonished in my life. She made
each of the girls a fat red pincushion like a heart, and each of us boys had a knife bought out of
the housekeeping (I mean housekeeper's own) money.
Bill Simpkins is happy as sub-under-gardener to Albert's uncle's lady's mother. They do keep
three gardeners--I knew they did. And our tramp still earns enough to sleep well on from our
dear old Pig-man.
Our last three days were entirely filled up with visits of farewell sympathy to all our many friends
who were so sorry to lose us. We promised to come and see them next year. I hope we shall.
Denny and Daisy went back to live with their father at Forest Hill. I don't think they'll ever be
again the victims of the Murdstone aunt--who is really a great-aunt and about twice as much in
the autumn of her days as our new Albert's-uncle aunt. I think they plucked up spirit enough to
tell their father they didn't like her--which they'd never thought of doing before. Our own robber
says their holidays in the country did them both a great deal of good. And he says us Bastables
have certainly taught Daisy and Denny the rudiments of the art of making home happy. I believe
they have thought of several quite new naughty things entirely on their own--and done them
too--since they came back from the Moat House.
I wish you didn't grow up so quickly. Oswald can see that ere long he will be too old for the kind
of games we can all play, and he feels grown-upness creeping inordiously upon him. But
enough of this.
And now, gentle reader, farewell. If anything in these chronicles of the Wouldbegoods should
make you try to be good yourself, the author will be very glad, of course. But take my advice
and don't make a society for trying in. It is much easier without.
And do try to forget that Oswald has another name besides Bastable. The one beginning with
C., I mean. Perhaps you have not noticed what it was. If so, don't look back for it. It is a name
no manly boy would like to be called by--if he spoke the truth. Oswald is said to be a very manly
boy, and he despises that name, and will never give it to his own son when he has one. Not if a
rich relative offered to leave him an immense fortune if he did. Oswald would still be firm. He
would, on the honour of the House of Bastable.

INTRODUCTION
These disjointed thoughts about one of Leonard Merrick's most articulate books must begin with
a personal confession.
For many years I walked about this earth avoiding the works of Leonard Merrick, as other men
might have avoided an onion. This insane aversion was created in my mind chiefly by admirers
of what is called the "cheerful" note in fiction. Such people are completely agreed in
pronouncing Mr. Merrick to be a pessimistic writer. I hate pessimistic writers.
Years ago, when I was of an age when the mind responds acutely to exterior impressions, some
well-meaning uncle, or other fool, gave me a pessimistic book to read. This was a work of fiction
which the British Public had hailed as a masterpiece of humour. It represented, with an utter fury
of pessimism, the spiritual inadequacies of--but why go into details.
Now, I have to confess that for a long time I did Mr. Merrick the extraordinary injustice of
believing him to be the author of that popular masterpiece.
The mistake, though intellectually unpardonable, may perhaps be condoned on other grounds.
By virtue of that process of thought which we call the "association of ideas," I naturally
connected Mr. Merrick with this work of super-pessimism; my friends being so confirmed in their
belief that he was a super-pessimist.
But by virtue of a fortunate accident, I at last got the truth about Mr. Merrick. This event arose
from the action of a right-minded butcher, who, having exhausted his stock of _The PigeonFancier's Gazette_, sent me my weekly supply of dog-bones wrapped about with Leonard
Merrick.
These dog-bones happened to reach my house at a moment when no other kind of literary
nutriment was to be had. Having nothing better to read I read the dog-bone wrappers. Thus, by
dog-bones, was I brought to Merrick: the most jolly, amusing, and optimistic of all spiritual
friends.
The book to which these utterances are prefixed is to my mind one of the few _really_ amusing
books which have been published in England during my lifetime. But, then, I think that all of Mr.
Merrick's books are amusing: even his "earnest" books, such as _The Actor-Manager, When
Love Flies out o' the Window_, or _The Position of Peggy Harper_.
It is, of course, true that such novels as these are unlikely to be found congenial by those
persons who derive entertainment from fiction like my uncle's present. On the other hand, there
are people in the world with a capacity for being amused by psychological inquiry. To such
 2 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
people I would say: "Don't miss Merrick." The extraordinary cheerfulness of Mr. Merrick's
philosophy is a fact which will impress itself upon all folk who are able to take a really cheerful
view of life.
All of Mr. Merrick's sermons--I do not hesitate to call his novels "sermons," because no decent
novel can be anything else--all his sermons, I say, point to this conclusion: that people who go
out deliberately to look for happiness, to kick for it, and fight for it, or who try to buy it with
money, will miss happiness; this being a state of heart--a mere outgrowth, more often to be
found by a careless and self-forgetful vagrant than by the deliberate and self-conscious seeker.
A cheerful doctrine this. Not only cheerful, but self-evidently true. How right it is, and how
cheerful it is, to think that while philosophers and clergymen strut about this world looking out,
and smelling out, for its prime experiences, more careless and less celebrated men are
continually finding such things, without effort, without care, in irregular and unconsecrated
places.
In novel after novel, Mr. Merrick has preached the same good-humoured, cheerful doctrine: the
doctrine of anti-fat. He asks us to believe--he _makes_ us believe--that a man (or woman) is not
merely virtuous, but merely sane, who exchanges the fats of fulfilment for the little lean
pleasures of honourable hope and high endeavour. Oh wise, oh witty Mr. Merrick!
Mr. Merrick has not, to my knowledge, written one novel in which his hero is represented as
having achieved complacency. Mr. Merrick's heroes all undergo the very human experience of
"hitting a snag." They are none of them represented as _enjoying_ this experience; but none of
them whimper and none of them "rat."
If anybody could prove to me that Mr. Merrick had ever invented a hero who submitted tamely to
tame success, to fat prosperity; or who had stepped, were it ever so lightly, into the dirty morass
of accepted comfort, then would I cheerfully admit to anybody that Leonard Merrick is a
Pessimistic Writer. But until this proof be forthcoming, I stick to my opinion: I stick to the
conviction that Mr. Merrick is the gayest, cheer fullest, and most courageous of living humorists.
This opinion is a general opinion, applicable to Mr. Merrick's general work. This morning,
however, I am asked to narrow my field of view: to contemplate not so much Mr. Merrick at large
as Mr. Merrick in particular: to look at Mr. Merrick in his relationship to this one particular book:
_A Chair on the Boulevard_.
Now, if I say, as I have said, that Mr. Merrick is cheerful in his capacity of solemn novelist, what
am I to say of Mr. Merrick in his lighter aspect, that of a writer of _feuilletons?_ Addressing
myself to an imaginary audience of Magazine Enthusiasts, I ask them to tell me whether, judged
even by comparison with their favourite fiction, some of the stories to be found in this volume
are not exquisitely amusing?
The first story in the book--that which Mr. Merrick calls "The Tragedy of a Comic Song"--is in my
view the funniest story of this century: but I don't ask or expect the Magazine Enthusiast to
share this view or to endorse that judgment. "The Tragedy of a Comic Song" is essentially one
of those productions in which the reader is expected to collaborate. The author has deliberately
contrived certain voids of narrative; and his reader is expected to populate these anecdotal
wastes. This is asking more than it is fair to ask of a Magazine Enthusiast. No genuine
Magazine reader cares for the elusive or allusive style in fiction. "The Tragedy of a Comic Song"

won't do for Bouverie Street, however well and completely it may do for me.
But there are other stories in this book. There is that screaming farce called "The Suicides in the
Rue Sombre." Now, then, you Magazine zealots, speak up and tell me truly: is there anything
too difficult for you in this? If so, the psychology of what is called "public taste" becomes a
subject not suited to public discussion.
The foregoing remarks and considerations apply equally to such stories as "The Dress Clothes
of M. Pomponnet" and "Tricotrin Entertains." There are other stories which delight me, as, for
example, "Little- Flower-of-the-Wood": but this jerks us back again to the essential Mr. Merrick:
he who demands collaboration.
There are, again, other stories, and yet others; but to write down all their titles here would be
merely to transcribe the index page of the book. Neither the reader nor I can afford to waste our
time like that.
I have said nothing about the technical qualities of Mr. Merrick's work. I don't intend to do so. It
has long been a conceit of mine to believe that professional vendors of letterpress should
reserve their mutual discussions of technique for technical occasions, such as those when men
of like mind and occupation sit at table, with a bottle between them.
I am convinced that Mr. Merrick is a very great and gifted man, deeply skilled in his profession. I
can bring forth arguments and proofs to support this conviction; but I fail utterly to see why I
should do so. To people who have a sense of that which is sincere and fresh in fiction, these
facts will be apparent. To them my arguments and illustrations would be profitless. As for those
honest persons to whom the excellencies of Merrick are not apparent, I can only think that
nothing which I or any other man could say would render them obvious. "Happiness is in
ourselves," as the Vicar remarked to the donkey who was pulling the lawn-mower.
Good luck, Leonard Merrick, and good cheer! I shout my greeting to you across the ripples of
that inky lake which is our common fishery.
A. NEIL LYONS.
A CHAIR ON THE BOULEVARD
THE TRAGEDY OF A COMIC SONG
I like to monopolise a table in a restaurant, unless a friend is with me, so I resented the young
man's presence. Besides, he had a melancholy face. If it hadn't been for the piano-organ, I don't
suppose I should have spoken to him. As the organ that was afflicting Lisle Street began to
volley a comic song of a day that was dead, he started.
"That tune!" he murmured in French. If I did not deceive myself, tears sprang to his eyes.
I was curious. Certainly, on both sides of the Channel, we had long ago had more than enough
of the tune--no self-respecting organ-grinder rattled it now. That the young Frenchman should
wince at the tune I understood. But that he should weep!

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
I smiled sympathetically. "We suffered from it over here as well," I remarked.
"I did not know," he said, in English that reproved my French, "it was sung in London
also--'Partant pour le Moulin'?"
"Under another name," I told him, "it was an epidemic."
Clearly, the organ had stirred distressing memories in him, for though we fell to chatting, I could
see that he neither talked nor dined with any relish. As luck would have it, too, the instrument of
torture resumed its répertoire well within hearing, and when "Partant pour le Moulin" was
reached again, he clasped his head.
"You find it so painful?" I inquired.
"Painful?" he exclaimed. "Monsieur, it is my 'istory, that comic tune! It is to me romance,
tragedy, ruin. Will you hear? Wait! I shall range my ideas. Listen:"
* * * * *
It is Paris, at Montmartre--we are before the door of a laundress. A girl approaches. Her gaze is
troubled, she frowns a little. What ails her? I shall tell you: the laundress has refused to deliver
her washing until her bill is paid. And the girl cannot pay it--not till Saturday-- and she has need
of things to put on. It is a moment of anxiety.
She opens the door. Some minutes pass. The girl reappears, holding under her arm a little
parcel. Good! she has triumphed. In coming out she sees a young man, pale, abstracted, who
stands before the shop. He does not attempt to enter. He stands motionless, regarding the
window with an air forlorn.
"Ah," she says to herself, "here is another customer who cannot pay his bill!"
But wait a little. After 'alf an hour what happens? She sees the young man again! This time he
stands before a modest restaurant. Does he go in? No, again no! He regards the window
sorrowfully. He sighs. The dejection of his attitude would melt a stone.
"Poor boy," she thought; "he cannot pay for a dinner either!"
The affair is not finished. How the summer day is beautiful--she will do some footing! Figure
yourself that once more she perceives the young man. Now it is before the mont-de-piété, the
pawnbroker's. She watches him attentively. Here, at least, he will enter, she does not doubt.
She is wrong. It is the same thing--he regards, he laments, he turns away!
"Oh, mon Dieu," she said. "Nothing remains to him to pawn even!"
It is too strong! She addressed him:
"Monsieur!"
But, when she has said "Monsieur," there is the question how she shall continue. Now the

young man regards the girl instead of the pawnbroker's. Her features are pretty--or "pretty well";
her costume has been made by herself, but it is not bad; and she has chic--above all she has
chic. He asks:
"What can I have the pleasure to do for you?"
Remark that she is bohemian, and he also.
The conversation was like this:
"Monsieur, three times this morning I have seen you. It was impossible that I resist speaking.
You have grief?"
"Frightful!" he said.
"Perhaps," she added timidly, "you have hunger also?"
"A hunger insupportable, mademoiselle!"
"I myself am extremely hard up, monsieur, but will you permit that I offer you what I can?"
"Angel!" the young man exclaimed. "There must be wings under your coat. But I beg of you not
to fly yet. I shall tell you the reason of my grief. If you will do me the honour to seat yourself at
the café opposite, we shall be able to talk more pleasantly."
This appeared strange enough, this invitation from a young man who she had supposed was
starving; but wait a little! Her amazement increased when, to pay for the wine he had ordered,
her companion threw on to the table a bank-note with a gesture absolutely careless.
She was in danger of distrusting her eyes.
"Is it a dream?" she cried. "Is it a vision from the _Thousand and One Nights_, or is it really a
bank-note?"
"Mademoiselle, it is the mess of pottage," the young man answered gloomily. "It is the cause of
my sadness: for that miserable money, and more that is to come, I have sold my birthright."
She was on a ship--no, what is it, your expression?--"at sea"!
"I am a poet," he explained; "but perhaps you may not know my work; I am not celebrated. I am
Tricotrin, mademoiselle--Gustave Tricotrin, at your feet! For years I have written, aided by
ambition, and an uncle who manufactures silk in Lyons. Well, the time is arrived when he is
monstrous, this uncle. He says to me, 'Gustave, this cannot last--you make no living, you make
nothing but debts. (My tragedies he ignores.) Either you must be a poet who makes money, or
you must be a partner who makes silk,' How could I defy him?--he holds the purse. It was
unavoidable that I stooped. He has given me a sum to satisfy my creditors, and Monday I depart
for Lyons. In the meantime, I take tender farewells of the familiar scenes I shall perhaps never
behold again."

"How I have been mistaken!" she exclaimed. And then: "But the hunger you confessed?"
"Of the soul, mademoiselle," said the poet--"the most bitter!"
"And you have no difficulties with the laundress?"
"None," he groaned. "But in the bright days of poverty that have fled for ever, I have had many
difficulties with her. This morning I reconstituted the situation--I imagined myself without a sou,
and without a collar."
"The little restaurant," she questioned, "where I saw you dining on the odour?"
"I figured fondly to myself that I was ravenous and that I dared not enter. It was sublime."
"The mont-de-piété?"
"There imagination restored to me the vanished moments when I have mounted with suspense,
and my least deplorable suit of clothes." His emotion was profound. "It is my youth to which I am
bidding adieu!" he cried. "It is more than that--it is my aspirations and my renown!"
"But you have said that you have no renown," she reminded him.
"So much the more painful," said the young man; "the hussy we could not win is always the
fairest--I part from renown even more despairingly than from youth."
She felt an amusement, an interest. But soon it was the turn of him to feel an interest--the
interest that had consequences so important, so 'eart-breaking, so _fatales_! He had demanded
of her, most naturally, her history, and this she related to him in a style dramatic. Myself, I have
not the style dramatic, though I avow to you I admire that.
"We are in a provincial town," she said to the young man, "we are in Rouen--the workroom of a
modiste. Have no embarrassment, monsieur Tricotrin, you, at least, are invisible to the girls who
sew! They sew all day and talk little--already they are _tristes_, resigned. Among them sits one
who is different--one passionate, ambitious--a girl who burns to be _divette_, singer, who is
devoured by longings for applause, fashion, wealth. She has made the acquaintance of a little
pastrycook. He has become fascinated, they are affianced. In a month she will be married."
The young man, Tricotrin, well understood that the girl she described was herself.
"What does she consider while she sits sewing?" she continued. "That the pastrycook loves her,
that he is generous, that she will do her most to be to him a good wife? Not at all. Far from that!
She considers, on the contrary, that she was a fool to promise him; she considers how she shall
escape--from him, from Rouen, from her ennui-- she seeks to fly to Paris. Alas! she has no
money, not a franc. And she sews--always she sews in the dull room--and her spirit rebels."
"Good!" said the poet. "It is a capital first instalment."
"The time goes on. There remains only a week to the marriage morning. The little home is
prepared, the little pastrycook is full of joy. _Alors_, one evening they go out; for her the sole

attraction in the town is the hall of varieties. Yes, it is third class, it is not great things; however,
it is the only one in Rouen. He purchases two tickets. What a misfortune--it is the last temptation
to her! They stroll back; she takes his arm--under the moon, under the stars; but she sees only
the lamps of Paris!--she sees only that he can say nothing she cares to hear!"
"Ah, unhappy man!" murmured the poet.
"They sit at a café table, and he talks, the fiancé, of the bliss that is to come to them. She
attends to not a word, not a syllable. While she smiles, she questions herself, frenzied, how she
can escape. She has commanded a _sirop_. As she lifts her glass to the syphon, her gaze falls
on the ring she wears--the ring of their betrothal. 'To the future, cher ange!' says the fiancé. 'To
the future, vieux chéri!' she says. And she laughs in her heart--for she resolves to sell the ring!"
Tricotrin had become absolutely enthralled.
"She obtained for the ring forty-five francs the next day--and for the little pastrycook all is
finished. She wrote him a letter--'Good-bye.' He has lost his reason. Mad with despair, he has
flung himself before an electric car, and is killed.... It is strange," she added to the poet, who
regarded her with consternation, "that I did not think sooner of the ring that was always on my
finger, n'est-ce-pas? It may be that never before had I felt so furious an impulse to desert him. It
may be also--that there was no ring and no pastrycook!" And she broke into peals of laughter.
"Ah, mon Dieu," exclaimed the young man, "but you are enchanting! Let us go to breakfast--you
are the kindred soul I have looked for all my life. By-the-bye, I may as well know your name?"
Then, monsieur, this poor girl who had trembled before her laundress, she told him a name
which was going, in a while, to crowd the Ambassadeurs and be famous through all Paris--a
name which was to mean caprices, folly, extravagance the most wilful and reckless. She
answered--and it said nothing yet--"My name is Paulette Fleury."
* * * * *
The piano-organ stopped short, as if it knew the Frenchman had reached a crisis in his
narrative. He folded his arms and nodded impressively.
"Voilà! Monsieur, I 'ave introduced you to Paulette Fleury! It was her beginning."
He offered me a cigarette, and frowned, lost in thought, at the lady who was chopping bread
behind the counter.
"Listen," he resumed.

They have breakfasted; they have fed the sparrows around their chairs, and they have strolled
under the green trees in the sunshine. She was singing then at a little café-concert the most
obscure. It is arranged, before they part, that in the evening he shall go to applaud her.
He had a friend, young also, a composer, named Nicolas Pitou. I cannot express to you the

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
devotion that existed between them. Pitou was employed at a publisher's, but the publisher paid
him not much better than his art. The comrades have shared everything: the loans from the
mont-de-piété, the attic, and the dreams. In Montmartre it was said "Tricotrin and Pitou" as one
says "Orestes and Pylades." It is beautiful such affection, hein? Listen!
Tricotrin has recounted to his friend his meeting with Paulette, and when the hour for the
concert is arrived, Pitou accompanied him. The musician, however, was, perhaps, the more
sedate. He has gone with little expectation; his interest was not high.
What a surprise he has had! He has found her an actress--an artist to the ends of the fingers.
Tricotrin was astonished also. The two friends, the poet and the composer, said "Mon Dieu!"
They regarded the one the other. They said "Mon Dieu!" again. Soon Pitou has requested of
Tricotrin an introduction. It is agreed. Tricotrin has presented his friend, and invited the
_chanteuse_ to drink a bock--a glass of beer.... A propos, you take a liqueur, monsieur, yes?
What liqueur you take? Sst, garçon!... Well, you conjecture, no doubt, what I shall say? Before
the bock was finished, they were in love with her--both!
At the door of her lodging, Paulette has given to each a pressure of the hand, and said gently,
"Till to-morrow."
"I worship her!" Tricotrin told Pitou.
"I have found my ideal!" Pitou answered Tricotrin.
It is superb, such friendship, hein?
In the mind of the poet who had accomplished tragedies majestic--in the mind of the composer,
the most classical in Montmartre--there had been born a new ambition: it was to write a comic
song for Paulette Fleury!
It appears to you droll, perhaps? Monsieur, to her lover, the humblest _divette_ is more than
Patti. In all the world there can be no joy so thrilling as to hear the music of one's brain sung by
the woman one adores--unless it be to hear the woman one adores give forth one's verse. I
believe it has been accepted as a fact, this; nevertheless it is true.
Yes, already the idea had come to them, and Paulette was well pleased when they told her of it.
Oh, she knew they loved her, both, and with both she coquetted. But with their intention she did
not coquet; as to that she was in earnest. Every day they discussed it with enthusiasm-- they
were to write a song that should make for her a furore.
What happened? I shall tell you. Monday, when Tricotrin was to depart for Lyons, he informed
his uncle that he will not go. No less than that! His uncle was furious--I do not blame him--but
naturally Tricotrin has argued, "If I am to create for Paulette her great chance, I must remain in
Paris to study Paulette! I cannot create in an atmosphere of commerce. I require the
Montmartrois, the boulevards, the inspiration of her presence." Isn't it?
And Pitou--whose very soul had been enraptured in his leisure by a fugue he was
composing--Pitou would have no more of it. He allowed the fugue to grow dusty, while day and
night he thought always of refrains that ran "_Zim-la-zim-la zim-boum-boum!_" Constantly they

conferred, the comrades. They told the one the other how they loved her; and then they beat
their heads, and besought of Providence a fine idea for the comic song.
It was their thought supreme. The silk manufacturer has washed his 'ands of Tricotrin, but he
has not cared--there remained to him still one of the bank-notes. As for Pitou, who neglected
everything except to find his melody for Paulette, the publisher has given him the sack. Their
acquaintances ridiculed the sacrifices made for her. But, monsieur, when a man loves truly, to
make a sacrifice for the woman is to make a present to himself.
Nevertheless I avow to you that they fretted because of her coquetry. One hour it seemed that
Pitou had gained her heart; the next her encouragement has been all to Tricotrin. Sometimes
they have said to her:
"Paulette, it is true we are as Orestes and Pylades, but there can be only one King of Eden at
the time. Is it Orestes, or Pylades that you mean to crown?"
Then she would laugh and reply:
"How can I say? I like you both so much I can never make up my mind which to like best."
It was not satisfactory.
And always she added. "In the meantime, where is the song?"
Ah, the song, that song, how they have sought it!--on the Butte, and in the Bois, and round the
Halles. Often they have tramped Paris till daybreak, meditating the great chance for Paulette.
And at last the poet has discovered it: for each verse a different phase of life, but through it all,
the pursuit of gaiety, the fever of the dance--the gaiety of youth, the gaiety of dotage, the gaiety
of despair! It should be the song of the pleasure-seekers--the voices of Paris when the lamps
are lit.
Monsieur, if we sat 'ere in the restaurant until it closed, I could not describe to you how
passionately Tricotrin, the devoted Tricotrin, worked for her. He has studied her without cease;
he has studied her attitudes, her expressions. He has taken his lyric as if it were material and
cut it to her figure; he has taken it as if it were plaster, and moulded it upon her mannerisms.
There was not a _moue_ that she made, not a pretty trick that she had, not a word that she
liked to sing for which he did not provide an opportunity. At the last line, when the pen fell from
his fingers, he shouted to Pitou, "Comrade, be brave--I have won her!"
And Pitou? Monsieur, if we sat 'ere till they prepared the tables for déjeuner to-morrow, I could
not describe to you how passionately Pitou, the devoted Pitou, worked that she might have a
grand popularity by his music. At dawn, when he has found that _strepitoso_ passage, which is
the hurrying of the feet, he wakened the poet and cried, "Mon ami, I pity you--she is mine!" It
was the souls of two men when it was finished, that comic song they made for her! It was the
song the organ has ground out--"Partant pour le Moulin."
And then they rehearsed it, the three of them, over and over, inventing always new effects. And
then the night for the song is arrived. It has rained all day, and they have walked together in the
rain--the singer, and the men who loved her, both--to the little café-concert where she would

appear.
They tremble in the room, among the crowd, Pitou and Tricotrin; they are agitated. There are
others who sing--it says nothing to them. In the room, in the Future, there is only Paulette!
It is very hot in the café-concert, and there is too much noise. At last they ask her: "Is she
nervous?" She shakes her head: "Mais non!" She smiles to them.
Attend! It is her turn. Ouf; but it is hot in the café-concert, and there is too much noise! She
mounts the platform. The audience are careless; it continues, the jingle of the glasses, the hum
of talk. She begins. Beneath the table Tricotrin has gripped the hand of Pitou.
Wait! Regard the crowd that look at her! The glasses are silent, now, hein? The talk has
stopped. To a great actress is come her chance. There is _not_ too much noise in the caféconcert!
But, when she finished! What an uproar! Never will she forget it. A thousand times she has told
the story, how it was written--the song-- and how it made her famous. Before two weeks she
was the attraction of the Ambassadeurs, and all Paris has raved of Paulette Fleury.
Tricotrin and Pitou were mad with joy. Certainly Paris did not rave of Pitou nor Tricotrin--there
have not been many that remembered who wrote the song; and it earned no money for them,
either, because it was hers --the gift of their love. Still, they were enraptured. To both of them
she owed equally, and more than ever it was a question which would be the happy man.
Listen! When they are gone to call on her one afternoon she was not at 'ome. What had
happened? I shall tell you. There was a noodle, rich-- what you call a "Johnnie in the
Stalls"--who became infatuated with her at the Ambassadeurs. He whistled "Partant pour le
Moulin" all the days, and went to hear it all the nights. Well, she was not at 'ome because she
had married him. Absolutely they were married! Her lovers have been told it at the door.
What a moment! Figure yourself what they have suffered, both! They had worshipped her, they
had made sacrifices for her, they had created for her her grand success; and, as a
consequence of that song, she was the wife of the "Johnnie in the Stalls"!
* * * * *
Far down the street, but yet distinct, the organ revived the tune again. My Frenchman
shuddered, and got up.
"I cannot support it," he murmured. "You understand? The associations are too pathetic."
"They must be harrowing," I said. "Before you go, there is one thing I should like to ask you, if I
may. Have I had the honour of meeting monsieur Tricotrin, or monsieur Pitou?"
He stroked his hat, and gazed at me in sad surprise. "Ah, but neither, monsieur," he groaned.
"The associations are much more 'arrowing than that--I was the 'Johnnie in the Stalls'!"
TRICOTRIN ENTERTAINS

One night when Pitou went home, an unaccustomed perfume floated to meet him on the stairs.
He climbed them in amazement.
"If we lived in an age of miracles I should conclude that Tricotrin was smoking a cigar," he said
to himself. "What can it be?"
The pair occupied a garret in the rue des Trois Frères at this time, where their window, in sore
need of repairs, commanded an unrivalled view of the dirty steps descending to the passage
des Abbesses. To-night, behold Tricotrin pacing the garret with dignity, between his lips an
Havannah that could have cost no less than a franc. The composer rubbed his eyes.
"Have they made you an Academician?" he stammered. "Or has your uncle, the silk
manufacturer, died and left you his business?"
"My friend," replied the poet, "prepare yourself forthwith for 'a New and Powerful Serial of the
Most Absorbing Interest'! I am no longer the young man who went out this evening--I am a
celebrity."
"I thought," said the composer, "that it couldn't be you when I saw the cigar."
"Figure yourself," continued Tricotrin, "that at nine o'clock I was wandering on the Grand
Boulevard with a thirst that could have consumed a brewery. I might mention that I had also
empty pockets, but--"
"It would be to pad the powerful Serial shamelessly," said Pitou: "there are things that one takes
for granted."
"At the corner of the place de l'Opera a fellow passed me whom I knew and yet did not know; I
could not recall where it was we had met. I turned and followed him, racking my brains the
while. Suddenly I remembered--"
"Pardon me," interrupted the composer, "but I have read _Bel-Ami_ myself. Oh, it is quite
evident that you are a celebrity--you have already forgotten how to be original!"
"There is a resemblance, it is true," admitted Tricotrin. "However, Maupassant had no copyright
in the place de l'Opera. I say that I remembered the man; I had known him when he was in the
advertisement business in Lyons. Well, we have supped together; he is in a position to do me a
service--he will ask an editor to publish an Interview with me!"
"An Interview?" exclaimed Pitou. "You are to be Interviewed? Ah, no, my poor friend, too much
meat has unhinged your reason! Go to sleep--you will be hungry and sane again to-morrow."
"It will startle some of them, hein? 'Gustave Tricotrin at Home'--in the illustrated edition of _Le
Demi-Mot?_"
"Illustrated?" gasped Pitou. He looked round the attic. "Did I understand you to say 'illustrated'?"
"Well, well," said Tricotrin, "we shall move the beds! And, when the concierge nods, perhaps we
can borrow the palm from the portals. With a palm and an amiable photographer, an air of

splendour is easily arrived at. I should like a screen--we will raise one from a studio in the rue
Ravignan. Mon Dieu! with a palm and a screen I foresee the most opulent effects. 'A Corner of
the Study'--we can put the screen in front of the washhand-stand, and litter the table with
manuscripts--you will admit that we have a sufficiency of manuscripts?--no one will know that
they have all been rejected. Also, a painter in the rue Ravignan might lend us a few of his
failures--'Before you go, let me show you my pictures,' said monsieur Tricotrin: 'I am an ardent
collector'!"
In Montmartre the sight of two "types" shifting household gods makes no sensation--the sails of
the remaining windmills still revolve. On the day that it had its likeness taken, the attic was
temporarily transformed. At least a score of unappreciated masterpieces concealed the
dilapidation of the walls; the broken window was decorated with an Eastern fabric that had been
a cherished "property" of half the ateliers in Paris; the poet himself--with the palm drooping
gracefully above his head--mused in a massive chair, in which Solomon had been pronouncing
judgment until 12:15, when the poet had called for it. The appearance of exhaustion observed
by admirers of the poet's portrait was due to the chair's appalling weight. As he staggered under
it up the steps of the passage des Abbesses, the young man had feared he would expire on the
threshold of his fame.
However, the photographer proved as resourceful as could be desired, and perhaps the most
striking feature of the illustration was the spaciousness of the apartment in which monsieur
Tricotrin was presented to readers of _Le Demi-Mot._ The name of the thoroughfare was not
obtruded.
With what pride was that issue of the journal regarded in the rue des Trois Frères!
"Aha!" cried Tricotrin, who in moments persuaded himself that he really occupied such noble
quarters, "those who repudiated me in the days of my struggles will be a little repentant now,
hein? Stone Heart will discover that I was not wrong in relying on my genius!"
"I assume," said Pitou, "that 'Stone Heart' is your newest pet-name for the silk-manufacturing
uncle?"
"You catch my meaning precisely. I propose to send a copy of the paper to Lyons, with the
Interview artistically bordered by laurels; I cannot draw laurels myself, but there are plenty of
persons who can. We will find someone to do it when we palter with starvation at the Café du
Bel Avenir this evening--or perhaps we had better fast at the Lucullus Junior, instead; there is
occasionally some ink in the bottle there. I shall put the address in the margin--my uncle will not
know where it is, and on the grounds of euphony I have no fault to find with it. It would not
surprise me if I received an affectionate letter and a bank-note in reply--the perversity of human
nature delights in generosities to the prosperous."
"It is a fact," said Pitou. "That human nature!"
"Who knows?--he may even renew the allowance that he used to make me!"
"Upon my word, more unlikely things have happened," Pitou conceded.
"Mon Dieu, Nicolas, we shall again have enough to eat!"

"Ah, visionary!" exclaimed Pitou; "are there no bounds to your imagination?"
Now, the perversity to which the poet referred did inspire monsieur Rigaud, of Lyons, to loosen
his purse-strings. He wrote that he rejoiced to learn that Gustave was beginning to make his
way, and enclosed a present of two hundred and fifty francs. More, after an avuncular preamble
which the poet skipped--having a literary hatred of digression in the works of others--he even
hinted that the allowance might be resumed.
What a banquet there was in bohemia! How the glasses jingled afterwards in La Lune Rousse,
and oh, the beautiful hats that Germaine and Marcelle displayed on the next fine Sunday! Even
when the last ripples of the splash were stilled, the comrades swaggered gallantly on the
boulevard Rochechouart, for by any post might not the first instalment of that allowance arrive?
Weeks passed; and Tricotrin began to say, "It looks to me as if we needed another Interview!"
And then came a letter which was no less cordial than its predecessor, but which stunned the
unfortunate recipient like a warrant for his execution. Monsieur Rigaud stated that business
would bring him to Paris on the following evening and that he anticipated the pleasure of visiting
his nephew; he trusted that his dear Gustave would meet him at the station. The poet and
composer stared at each other with bloodless faces.
"You must call at his hotel instead," faltered Pitou at last.
"But you may be sure he will wish to see my elegant abode."
"'It is in the hands of the decorators. How unfortunate!'"
"He would propose to offer them suggestions; he is a born suggester."
"'Fever is raging in the house--a most infectious fever'; we will ask a medical student to give us
one."
"It would not explain my lodging in a slum meanwhile."
"Well, let us admit that there is nothing to be done; you will have to own up!"
"Are you insane? It is improvident youths like you, who come to lament their wasted lives. If I
could receive him this once as he expects to be received, we cannot doubt that it would mean
an income of two thousand francs to me. Prosperity dangles before us--shall I fail to clutch it?
Mon Dieu, what a catastrophe, his coming to Paris! Why cannot he conduct his business in
Lyons? Is there not enough money in the city of Lyons to satisfy him? O grasper! what greed!
Nicolas, my more than brother, if it were night when I took him to a sumptuous apartment, he
might not notice the name of the street--I could talk brilliantly as we turned the corner. Also I
could scintillate as I led him away. He would never know that it was not the rue des Trois
Frères."
"You are right," agreed Pitou; "but which is the pauper in our social circle whose sumptuous
apartment you propose to acquire?"

"One must consider," said Tricotrin. "Obviously, I am compelled to entertain in somebody's;
fortunately, I have two days to find it in. I shall now go forth!"
It was a genial morning, and the first person he accosted in the rue Ravignan was Goujaud,
painting in the patch of garden before the studios. "Tell me, Goujaud," exclaimed the poet,
"have you any gilded acquaintance who would permit me the use of his apartment for two hours
to-morrow evening?"
Goujaud reflected for some seconds, with his head to one side. "I have never done anything so
fine as this before," he observed; "regard the atmosphere of it!"
"It is execrable!" replied Tricotrin, and went next door to Flamant. "My old one," he explained, "I
have urgent need of a regal apartment for two hours to-morrow--have you a wealthy friend who
would accommodate me?"
"You may beautify your bedroom with all my possessions," returned Flamant heartily. "I have a
stuffed parrot that is most decorative, but I have not a friend that is wealthy."
"You express yourself like a First Course for the Foreigner," said Tricotrin, much annoyed.
"Devil take your stuffed parrot!"
The heat of the sun increased towards midday, and drops began to trickle under the young
man's hat. By four o'clock he had called upon sixty-two persons, exclusive of Sanquereau,
whom he had been unable to wake. He bethought himself of Lajeunie, the novelist; but Lajeunie
could offer him nothing more serviceable than a pass for the Elysée- Montmartre. "Now how is it
possible that I spend my life among such imbeciles?" groaned the unhappy poet; "one offers me
a parrot, and another a pass for a dancing-hall! Can I assure my uncle, who is a married man,
and produces silk in vast quantities, that I reside in a dancing-hall? Besides, we know those
passes--they are available only for ladies."
"It is true that you could not get in by it," assented Lajeunie, "but I give it to you freely. Take it,
my poor fellow! Though it may appear inadequate to the occasion, who knows but what it will
prove to be the basis of a fortune?"
"You are as crazy as the stories you write," said Tricotrin, "Still, it can go in my pocket." And he
made, exhausted, for a bench in the place Dancourt, where he apostrophised his fate.
Thus occupied, he fell asleep; and presently a young woman sauntered from the sidewalk
across the square. In the shady little place Dancourt is the little white Theatre Montmartre, and
she first perused the play-bill, and then contemplated the sleeping poet. It may have been that
she found something attractive in his bearing, or it may have been that ragamuffins sprawled
elsewhere; but, having determined to wait awhile, she selected the bench on which he reposed,
and forthwith woke him.
"Now this is nice!" he exclaimed, realising his lapse with a start.
"Oh, monsieur!" said she, blushing.
"Pardon; I referred to my having dozed when every moment is of consequence," he explained.

"And yet," he went on ruefully, "upon my soul, I cannot conjecture where I shall go next!"
Her response was so sympathetic that it tempted him to remain a little longer, and in five
minutes she was recounting her own perplexities. It transpired that she was a lady's-maid with a
holiday, and the problem before her was whether to spend her money on a theatre, or on a ball.
"Now that is a question which is disposed of instantly," said Tricotrin, "You shall spend your
money on a theatre, and go to a ball as well." And out fluttered the pink pass presented to him
by Lajeunie.
The girl's tongue was as lively as her gratitude. She was, she told him, maid to the famous
Colette Aubray, who had gone unattended that afternoon to visit the owner of a villa in the
country, where she would stay until the next day but one. "So you see, monsieur, we poor
servants are left alone in the flat to amuse ourselves as best we can!"
"Mon Dieu!" ejaculated Tricotrin, and added mentally, "It was decidedly the good kind fairies that
pointed to this bench!"
He proceeded to pay the young woman such ardent attentions that she assumed he meant to
accompany her to the ball, and her disappointment was extreme when he had to own that the
state of his finances forbade it. "All I can suggest, my dear Léonie," he concluded, "is that I shall
be your escort when you leave. It is abominable that you must have other partners in the
meantime, but I feel that you will be constant to me in your thoughts. I shall have much to tell
you--I shall whisper a secret in your ear; for, incredible as it may sound, my sweet child, you
alone in Paris have the power to save me!"
"Oh, monsieur!" faltered the admiring lady's-maid, "it has always been my great ambition to
save a young man, especially a young man who used such lovely language. I am sure, by the
way you talk, that you must be a poet!"
"Extraordinary," mused Tricotrin, "that all the world recognises me as a poet, excepting when it
reads my poetry!" And this led him to reflect that he must sell some of it, in order to provide
refreshment for Léonie before he begged her aid. Accordingly, he arranged to meet her when
the ball finished, and limped back to the attic, where he made up a choice assortment of his
wares.
He had resolved to try the office of _Le Demi-Mot;_ but his reception there was cold. "You
should not presume on our good nature," demurred the Editor; "only last month we had an
article on you, saying that you were highly talented, and now you ask us to publish your work
besides. There must be a limit to such things."
He examined the collection, nevertheless, with a depreciatory countenance, and offered ten
francs for three of the finest specimens. "From _Le Demi-Mot_ I would counsel you to accept
low terms," he said, with engaging interest, "on account of the prestige you, derive from
appearing in it."
"In truth it is a noble thing, prestige," admitted Tricotrin; "but, monsieur, I have never known a
man able to make a meal of it when he was starving, or to warm himself before it when he was
without a fire. Still--though it is a jumble-sale price--let them go!"

"Payment will be made in due course," said the Editor, and became immersed in
correspondence.
Tricotrin paled to the lips, and the next five minutes were terrible; indeed, he did not doubt that
he would have to limp elsewhere. At last he cried, "Well, let us say seven francs, cash! Seven
francs in one's fist are worth ten in due course." And thus the bargain was concluded.
"It was well for Hercules that none of his labours was the extraction of payment from an editor!"
panted the poet on the doorstep. But he was now enabled to fête the lady's-maid in grand style,
and--not to be outdone in generosity--she placed mademoiselle Aubray's flat at his disposal
directly he asked for it.
"You have accomplished a miracle!" averred Pitou, in the small hours, when he heard the news.
Tricotrin waved a careless hand. "To a man of resource all things are possible!" he murmured.
The next evening the silk manufacturer was warmly embraced on the platform, and not a little
surprised to learn that his nephew expected a visit at once. However, the young man's
consternation was so profound when objections were made that, in the end, they were
withdrawn. Tricotrin directed the driver after monsieur Rigaud was in the cab, and, on their
reaching the courtyard, there was Léonie, all frills, ready to carry the handbag.
"Your servant?" inquired monsieur Rigaud, with some disapproval, as they went upstairs; "she
is rather fancifully dressed, hein?"
"Is it so?" answered Tricotrin. "Perhaps a bachelor is not sufficiently observant in these matters.
Still, she is an attentive domestic. Take off your things, my dear uncle, and make yourself at
home. What joy it gives me to see you here!"
"Mon Dieu," exclaimed the silk manufacturer, looking about him, "you have a place fit for a
prince! It must have cost a pretty penny."
"Between ourselves," said Tricotrin, "I often reproach myself for what I spent on it; I could make
very good use to-day of some of the money I squandered."
"What curtains!" murmured monsieur Rigaud, fingering the silk enraptured. "The quality is
superb! What may they have charged you for these curtains?"
"It was years ago--upon my word I do not remember," drawled Tricotrin, who had no idea
whether he ought to say five hundred francs, or five thousand. "Also, you must not think I have
bought everything you see-- many of the pictures and bronzes are presents from admirers of my
work. It is gratifying, hein?"
"I--I--To confess the truth, we had not heard of your triumphs," admitted monsieur Rigaud; "I did
not dream you were so successful."
"Ah, it is in a very modest way," Tricotrin replied. "I am not a millionaire, I assure you! On the
contrary, it is often difficult to make both ends meet--although," he added hurriedly, "I live with
the utmost economy, my uncle. The days of my thoughtlessness are past. A man should save,

a man should provide for the future."
At this moment he was astonished to see Léonie open the door and announce that dinner was
served. She had been even better than her word.
"Dinner?" cried monsieur Rigaud. "Ah, now I understand why you were so dejected when I
would not come!"
"Bah, it will be a very simple meal," said his nephew, "but after a journey one must eat. Let us
go in." He was turning the wrong way, but Léonie's eye saved him.
"Come," he proceeded, taking his seat, "some soup--some good soup! What will you drink, my
uncle?"
"On the sideboard I see champagne," chuckled monsieur Rigaud; "you treat the old man well,
you rogue!"
"Hah," said Tricotrin, who had not observed it, "the cellar, I own, is an extravagance of mine!
Alone, I drink only mineral waters, or a little claret, much diluted; but to my dearest friends I
must give the dearest wines. Léonie, champagne!" It was a capital dinner, and the cigars and
cigarettes that Léonie put on the table with the coffee were of the highest excellence. Agreeable
conversation whiled away some hours, and Tricotrin began to look for his uncle to get up. But it
was raining smartly, and monsieur Rigaud was reluctant to bestir himself. Another hour lagged
by, and at last Tricotrin faltered:
"I fear I must beg you to excuse me for leaving you, my uncle; it is most annoying, but I am
compelled to go out. The fact is, I have consented to collaborate with Capus, and he is so
eccentric, this dear Alfred--we shall be at work all night."
"Go, my good Gustave," said his uncle readily; "and, as I am very tired, if you have no objection,
I will occupy your bed."
Tricotrin's jaw dropped, and it was by a supreme effort that he stammered how pleased the
arrangement would make him. To intensify the fix, Leonie and the cook had
disappeared--doubtless to the mansarde in which they slept--and he was left to cope with the
catastrophe alone. However, having switched on the lights, he conducted the elderly gentleman
to an enticing apartment. He wished him an affectionate "good-night," and after promising to
wake him early, made for home, leaving the manufacturer sleepily surveying the room's imperial
splendour.
"What magnificence!" soliloquised monsieur Rigaud. "What toilet articles!" He got into bed.
"What a coverlet--there must be twenty thousand francs on top of me!"
He had not slumbered under them long when he was aroused by such a commotion that he
feared for the action of his heart. Blinking in the glare, he perceived Léonie in scanty attire,
distracted on her knees-- and, by the bedside, a beautiful lady in a travelling cloak, raging with
the air of a lioness.
"Go away!" quavered the manufacturer. "What is the meaning of this intrusion?"
 18 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
"Intrusion?" raved the lady. "That is what you will explain, monsieur! How comes it that you are
in my bed?"
"Yours?" ejaculated monsieur Rigaud. "What is it you say? You are making a grave error, for
which you will apologise, madame!"
"Ah, hold me back," pleaded the lady, throwing up her eyes, "hold me back or I shall assault
him!" She flung to Leonie. "Wretched girl, you shall pay for this! Not content with lavishing my
champagne and my friend's cigars on your lover, you must put him to recuperate in my room!"
"Oh!" gasped the manufacturer, and hid his head under the priceless coverlet. "Such an
imputation is unpardonable," he roared, reappearing. "I am monsieur Rigaud, of Lyons; the flat
belongs to my nephew, monsieur Tricotrin; I request you to retire!"
"Imbecile!" screamed the lady; "the flat belongs to _me_--Colette Aubray. And your presence
may ruin me--I expect a visitor on most important business! He has not my self-control; if he
finds you here he will most certainly send you a challenge. He is the best swordsman in Paris! I
advise you to believe me, for you have just five minutes to save your life!"
"Monsieur," wailed Léonie, "you have been deceived!" And, between her sobs, she confessed
the circumstances, which he heard with the greatest difficulty, owing to the chattering of his
teeth.
The rain was descending in cataracts when monsieur Rigaud got outside, but though the trams
and the trains had both stopped running, and cabs were as dear as radium, his fury was so
tempestuous that nothing could deter him from reaching the poet's real abode. His attack on the
front door warned Tricotrin and Pitou what had happened, and they raised themselves,
blanched, from their pillows, to receive his curses. It was impossible to reason with him, and he
launched the most frightful denunciation at his nephew for an hour, when the abatement of the
downpour permitted him to depart. More, at noon, who should arrive but Leonie in tears! She
had been dismissed from her employment, and came to beg the poet to intercede for her.
"What calamities!" groaned Tricotrin. "How fruitless are man's noblest endeavours without the
favouring breeze! I shall drown myself at eight o'clock. However, I will readily plead for you first,
if your mistress will receive me."
By the maid's advice he presented himself late in the day, and when he had cooled his heels in
the salon for some time, a lady entered, who was of such ravishing appearance that his head
swam.
"Monsieur Tricotrin?" she inquired haughtily. "I have heard your name from your uncle,
monsieur. Are you here to visit my servant?"
"Mademoiselle," he faltered, "I am here to throw myself on your mercy. At eight o'clock I have
decided to commit suicide, for I am ruined. The only hope left me is to win your pardon before I
die."
"I suppose your uncle has disowned you?" she said. "Naturally! It was a pretty situation to put
him in. How would you care to be in it yourself?"

"Alas, mademoiselle," sighed Tricotrin, "there are situations to which a poor poet may not
aspire!"
After regarding him silently she exclaimed, "I cannot understand what a boy with eyes like yours
saw in Léonie?"
"Merely good nature and a means to an end, believe me! If you would ease my last moments,
reinstate her in your service. Do not let me drown with the knowledge that another is suffering
for my fault! Mademoiselle, I entreat you--take her back!"
"And why should I ease your last moments?" she demurred.
"Because I have no right to ask it; because I have no defence for my sin towards you; because
you would be justified in trampling on me--and to pardon would be sublime!"
"You are very eloquent for my maid," returned the lady.
He shook his head. "Ah, no--I fear I am pleading for myself. For, if you reinstate the girl, it will
prove that you forgive the man--and I want your forgiveness so much!" He fell at her feet.
"Does your engagement for eight o'clock press, monsieur?" murmured the lady, smiling. "If you
could dine here again to-night, I might relent by degrees."
"And she is adorable!" he told Pitou. "I passed the most delicious evening of my life!" "It is
fortunate," observed Pitou, "for that, and your uncle's undying enmity, are all you have obtained
by your imposture. Remember that the evening cost two thousand francs a year!"
"Ah, misanthrope," cried Tricotrin radiantly, "there must be a crumpled roseleaf in every Eden!"
THE FATAL FLOROZONDE
Before Pitou, the composer, left for the Hague, he called on Théophile de Fronsac, the poet.
_La Voix Parisienne_ had lately appointed de Fronsac to its staff, on condition that he
contributed no poetry.
"Good-evening," said de Fronsac. "Mon Dieu! what shall I write about?"
"Write about my music," said Pitou, whose compositions had been rejected in every
arrondissement of Paris.
"Let us talk sanely," demurred de Fronsac. "My causerie is half a column short. Tell me
something interesting."
"Woman!" replied Pitou.
De Fronsac flicked his cigarette ash. "You remind me," he said, "how much I need a love affair;
my sensibilities should be stimulated. To continue to write with fervour I require to adore again."
"It is very easy to adore," observed Pitou.
 20 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
"Not at forty," lamented the other; "especially to a man in Class A. Don't forget, my young friend,
that I have loved and been loved persistently for twenty-three years. I cannot adore a repetition,
and it is impossible for me to discover a new type."
"All of which I understand," said Pitou, "excepting 'Class A.'"
"There are three kinds of men," explained the poet. "Class A are the men to whom women
inevitably surrender. Class B consists of those whom they trust by instinct and confide in on the
second day; these men acquire an extensive knowledge of the sex--but they always fall short of
winning the women for themselves. Class C women think of merely as 'the others'--they do not
count; eventually they marry, and try to persuade their wives that they were devils of fellows
when they were young. However, such reflections will not assist me to finish my causerie, for I
wrote them all last week."
"Talking of women," remarked Pitou, "a little blonde has come to live opposite our lodging. So
far we have only bowed from our windows, but I have christened her 'Lynette,' and Tricotrin has
made a poem about her. It is pathetic. The last verse--the others are not written yet--goes:
"'O window I watched in the days that are dead, Are you watched by a lover to-day?
Are glimpses caught now of another blonde head By a youth who lives over the way?
Does _she_ repeat words that Lynette's lips have said-- And does _he_ say what _I_ used to
say?'"
"What is the answer?" asked de Fronsac. "Is it a conundrum? In any case it is a poor substitute
for a half a column of prose in _La Voix_. How on earth am I to arrive at the bottom of the page?
If I am short in my copy, I shall be short in my rent; if I am short in my rent, I shall be put out of
doors; if I am put out of doors, I shall die of exposure. And much good it will do me that they
erect a statue to me in the next generation! Upon my word, I would stand a dinner--at the twofranc place where you may eat all you can hold--if you could give me a subject."
"It happens," said Pitou, "that I can give you a very strange one. As I am going to a foreign land,
I have been to the country to bid farewell to my parents; I came across an extraordinary girl."
"One who disliked presents?" inquired de Fronsac.
"I am not jesting. She is a dancer in a travelling circus. The flare and the drum wooed me one
night, and I went in. As a circus, well, you may imagine--a tent in a fair. My fauteuil was a plank,
and the orchestra surpassed the worst tortures of the Inquisition. And then, after the decrepit
horses, and a mangy lion, a girl came into the ring, with the most marvellous eyes I have ever
seen in a human face. They are green eyes, with golden lights in them."
"Really?" murmured the poet. "I have never been loved by a girl who had green eyes with
golden lights in them."
"I am glad you have never been loved by this one," returned the composer gravely; "she has a
curious history. All her lovers, without exception, have committed suicide."
"What?" said de Fronsac, staring.

"It is very queer. One of them had just inherited a hundred thousand francs--he hanged himself.
Another, an author from Italy, took poison, while all Rome was reading his novel. To be
infatuated by her is harmless enough, but to win her is invariably fatal within a few weeks. Some
time ago she attached herself to one of the troupe, and soon afterwards he discovered she was
deceiving him. He resolved to shoot her. He pointed a pistol at her breast. She simply
laughed--and _looked at him_. He turned the pistol on himself, and blew his brains out!"
De Fronsac had already written: "Here is the extraordinary history of a girl whom I discovered in
a fair." The next moment:
"But you repeat a rumour," he objected. "_La Voix Parisienne_ has a reputation; odd as the fact
may appear to you, people read it. If this is published in _La Voix_ it will attract attention. Soon
she will be promoted from a tent in a fair to a stage in Paris. Well, what happens? You tell me
she is beautiful, so she will have hundreds of admirers. Among the hundreds there will be one
she favours. And then? Unless he committed suicide in a few weeks, the paper would be
proved a liar. I should not be able to sleep of nights for fear he would not kill himself."
"My dear," exclaimed Pitou with emotion, "would I add to your anxieties? Rather than you
should be disturbed by anybody's living, let us dismiss the subject, and the dinner, and talk of
my new Symphony. On the other hand, I fail to see that the paper's reputation is your affair--it is
not your wife; and I am more than usually empty to-day."
"Your argument is sound," said de Fronsac. "Besides, the Editor refuses my poetry." And he
wrote without cessation for ten minutes.
The two-franc table-d'hôte excelled itself that evening, and Pitou did ample justice to the menu.
Behold how capricious is the jade, Fame! The poet whose verses had left him obscure,
accomplished in ten minutes a paragraph that fascinated all Paris. On the morrow people
pointed it out to one another; the morning after, other journals referred to it; in the afternoon the
Editor of _La Voix Parisienne_ was importuned with questions. No one believed the story to be
true, but not a soul could help wondering if it might be so.
When a day or two had passed, Pitou received from de Fronsac a note which ran:
"Send to me at once, I entreat thee, the name of that girl, and say where she can be found. The
managers of three variety theatres of the first class have sought me out and are eager to
engage her."
"Decidedly," said Pitou, "I have mistaken my vocation--I ought to have been a novelist!" And he
replied:
"The girl whose eyes suggested the story to me is called on the programmes 'Florozonde.' For
the rest, I know nothing, except that thou didst offer a dinner and I was hungry."
However, when he had written this, he destroyed it.
"Though I am unappreciated myself, and shall probably conclude in the Morgue," he mused,
"that is no excuse for my withholding prosperity from others. Doubtless the poor girl would
 22 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
rejoice to appear at three variety theatres of the first class, or even at one of them." He
answered simply:
"Her name is 'Florozonde'; she will be found in a circus at Chartres"-- and nearly suffocated with
laughter.
Then a little later the papers announced that Mlle. Florozonde--whose love by a strange series
of coincidences had always proved fatal--would be seen at La Coupole. Posters bearing the
name of "Florozonde"--yellow on black--invaded the boulevards. Her portrait caused crowds to
assemble, and "That girl who, they say, deals death, that Florozonde!" was to be heard as
constantly as ragtime.
By now Pitou was at the Hague, his necessities having driven him into the employment of a
Parisian who had opened a shop there for the sale of music and French pianos. When he read
the Paris papers, Pitou trembled so violently that the onlookers thought he must have ague.
Hilarity struggled with envy in his breast. "Ma foi!" he would say to himself, "it seems that my
destiny is to create successes for others. Here am I, exiled, and condemned to play cadenzas
all day in a piano warehouse, while she whom I invented, dances jubilant in Paris. I do not doubt
that she breakfasts at Armenonville, and dines at Paillard's."
And it was a fact that Florozonde was the fashion. As regards her eyes, at any rate, the young
man had not exaggerated more than was to be forgiven in an artist; her eyes were superb,
supernatural; and now that the spangled finery of a fair was replaced by the most triumphant of
audacities--now that a circus band had been exchanged for the orchestra of La Coupole--she
danced as she had not danced before. You say that a gorgeous costume cannot improve a
woman's dancing? Let a woman realise that you improve her appearance, and you improve
everything that she can do!
Nevertheless one does not pretend that it was owing to her talent, or her costume, or the weird
melody proposed by the chef d'orchestre, that she became the rage. Not at all. That was due to
her reputation. Sceptics might smile and murmur the French for "Rats!" but, again, nobody could
say positively that the tragedies had not occurred. And above all, there were the eyes--it was
conceded that a woman with eyes like that _ought_ to be abnormal. La Coupole was thronged
every night, and the stage doorkeeper grew rich, so numerous were the daring spirits,
coquetting with death, who tendered notes inviting the Fatal One to supper.
Somehow the suppers were rather dreary. The cause may have been that the guest was
handicapped by circumstances--to be good company without discarding the fatal air was
extremely difficult; also the cause may have been that the daring spirits felt their courage
forsake them in a tête-à-tête; but it is certain that once when Florozonde drove home in the
small hours to the tattered aunt who lived on her, she exclaimed violently that, "All this silly fake
was giving her the hump, and that she wished she were 'on the road' again, with a jolly good
fellow who was not afraid of her!"
Then the tattered aunt cooed to her, reminding her that little ducklings had run to her already
roasted, and adding that she (the tattered aunt) had never heard of equal luck in all the years
she had been in the show business.
"Ah, zut!" cried Florozonde. "It does not please me to be treated as if I had scarlet fever. If I lean
 23 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
towards a man, he turns pale."
"Life is good," said her aunt philosophically, "and men have no wish to die for the sake of an
embrace--remember your reputation! II faut souffrir pour être fatale. Look at your salary,
sweetie--and you have had nothing to do but hold your tongue! Ah, was anything ever heard like
it? A miracle of le bon Dieu!"
"It was monsieur de Fronsac, the journalist, who started it," said Florozonde. "I supposed he
had made it up, to give me a lift; but, ma foi, I think _he_ half believes it, too! What can have put
it in his head? I have a mind to ask him the next time he comes behind."
"What a madness!" exclaimed the old woman; "you might queer your pitch! Never, never
perform a trick with a confederate when you can work alone; that is one of the first rules of life. If
he thinks it is true, so much the better. Now get to bed, lovey, and think of pleasant things--what
did you have for supper?"
Florozonde was correct in her surmise--de Fronsac did half believe it, and de Fronsac was
accordingly much perturbed. Consider his dilemma! The nature of his pursuits had demanded a
love affair, and he had endeavoured conscientiously to comply, for the man was nothing if not
an artist. But, as he had said to Pitou, he had loved so much, and so many, that the thing was
practically impossible for him, He was like the pastrycook's boy who is habituated and bilious.
Then suddenly a new type, which he had despaired of finding, was displayed. His curiosity
awoke; and, fascinated in the first instance by her ghastly reputation, he was fascinated
gradually by her physical charms. Again he found himself enslaved by a woman--and the
woman, who owed her fame to his services, was clearly appreciative. But he had a strong
objection to committing suicide.
His eagerness for her love was only equalled by his dread of what might happen if she gave it to
him. Alternately he yearned, and shuddered, On Monday he cried, "Idiot, to be frightened by
such blague!" and on Tuesday he told himself, "All the same, there may be something in it!" It
was thus tortured that he paid his respects to Florozonde at the theatre on the evening after she
complained to her aunt. She was in her dressing-room, making ready to go.
"You have danced divinely," he said to her. "There is no longer a programme at La
Coupole--there is only 'Florozonde.'"
She smiled the mysterious smile that she was cultivating. "What have you been doing with
yourself, monsieur? I have not seen you all the week."
De Fronsac sighed expressively. "At my age one has the wisdom to avoid temptation."
"May it not be rather unkind to temptation?" she suggested, raising her marvellous eyes.
De Fronsac drew a step back. "Also I have had a great deal to do," he added formally; "I am a
busy man. For example, much as I should like to converse with you now.--" But his resolution
forsook him and he was unable to say that he had looked in only for a minute.
"Much as you would like to converse with me--?" questioned Florozonde.

"I ought, by rights, to be seated at my desk," he concluded lamely.
"I am pleased that you are not seated at your desk," she said.
"Because?" murmured de Fronsac, with unspeakable emotions.
"Because I have never thanked you enough for your interest in me, and I want to tell you that I
remember." She gave him her hand. He held it, battling with terror.
"Mademoiselle," he returned tremulously, "when I wrote the causerie you refer to, my interest in
you was purely the interest of a journalist, so for that I do not deserve your thanks. But since I
have had the honour to meet you I have experienced an interest altogether different; the interest
of a man, of a--a--" Here his teeth chattered, and he paused.
"Of a what?" she asked softly, with a dreamy air.
"Of a friend," he muttered. A gust of fear had made the "friend" an iceberg. But her clasp
tightened.
"I am glad," she said. "Ah, you have been good to me, monsieur! And if, in spite of everything, I
am sometimes sad, I am, at least, never ungrateful."
"You are sad?" faltered the vacillating victim. "Why?"
Her bosom rose. "Is success all a woman wants?"
"Ah!" exclaimed de Fronsac, in an impassioned quaver, "is that not life? To all of us there is the
unattainable--to you, to me!"
"To you?" she murmured. Her eyes were transcendental. Admiration and alarm tore him in
halves.
"In truth," he gasped, "I am the most miserable of men! What is genius, what is fame, when one
is lonely and unloved?"
She moved impetuously closer--so close that the perfume of her hair intoxicated him. His heart
seemed to knock against his ribs, and he felt the perspiration burst out on his brow. For an
instant he hesitated--on the edge of his grave, he thought. Then he dropped her hand, and
backed from her. "But why should I bore you with my griefs?" he stammered. "Au revoir,
mademoiselle!"
Outside the stage door he gave thanks for his self-control. Also, pale with the crisis, he
registered an oath not to approach her again.
Meanwhile the expatriated Pitou had remained disconsolate. Though the people at the Hague
spoke French, they said foreign things to him in it. He missed Montmartre--the interests of
home. While he waxed eloquent to customers on the tone of pianos, or the excellence of rival
composers' melodies, he was envying Florozonde in Paris. Florozonde, whom he had created,
obsessed the young man. In the evening he read about her at Van der Pyl's; on Sundays, when
 25 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
the train carried him to drink beer at Scheveningen, he read about her in the Kurhaus. And then
the unexpected happened. In this way:
Pitou was discharged.
Few things could have surprised him more, and, to tell the truth, few things could have troubled
him less. "It is better to starve in Paris than grow fat in Holland," he observed. He jingled his
capital in his trouser-pocket, in fancy savoured his dinner cooking at the Café du Bel Avenir,
and sped from the piano shop as if it had been on fire.
The clock pointed to a quarter to six as Nicolas Pitou, composer, emerged from the gare du
Nord, and lightly swinging the valise that contained his wardrobe, proceeded to the rue des
Trois Frères. Never had it looked dirtier, or sweeter. He threw himself on Tricotrin's neck;
embraced the concierge--which took her breath away, since she was ill-favoured and most
disagreeable; fared sumptuously for one franc fifty at the Café du Bel Avenir--where he narrated
adventures abroad that surpassed de Rougemont's; and went to La Coupole.
And there, jostled by the crowd, the poor fellow looked across the theatre at the triumphant
woman he had invented--and fell in love with her.
One would have said there was more than the width of a theatre between them--one would
have said the distance was interminable. Who in the audience could suspect that Florozonde
would have been unknown but for a boy in the Promenoir?
Yes, he fell in love--with her beauty, her grace--perhaps also with the circumstances. The
theatre rang with plaudits; the curtain hid her; and he went out, dizzy with romance. He could
not hope to speak to her to-night, but he was curious to see her when she left. He decided that
on the morrow he would call upon de Fronsac, whom she doubtless knew now, and ask him for
an introduction. Promising himself this, he reached the stage door--where de Fronsac, with
trembling limbs, stood giving thanks for his self-control.
"My friend!" cried Pitou enthusiastically, "how rejoiced I am to meet you!" and nearly wrung his
hand off.
"Aïe! Gently!" expostulated de Fronsac, writhing. "Aïe, aïe! I did not know you loved me so
much. So you are back from Sweden, hein?"
"Yes. I have not been there, but why should we argue about geography? What were you doing
as I came up--reciting your poems? By the way, I have a favour to ask; I want you to introduce
me to Florozonde."
"Never!" answered the poet firmly; "I have too much affection for you-- I have just resolved not
to see her again myself. Besides, I thought you knew her in the circus?"
"I never spoke to her there--I simply admired her from the plank. Come, take me inside, and
present me!"
"It is impossible," persisted de Fronsac; "I tell you I will not venture near her any more. Also, she
is coming out--that is her coupé that you see waiting."

She came out as he spoke, and, affecting not to recognise him, moved rapidly towards the
carriage. But this would not do for Pitou at all. "Mademoiselle!" he exclaimed, sweeping his hat
nearly to the pavement.
"Yes, well?" she said sharply, turning.
"I have just begged my friend de Fronsac to present me to you, and he feared you might not
pardon his presumption. May I implore you to pardon mine?"
She smiled. There was the instant in which neither the man nor the woman knows who will
speak next, nor what is to be said--the instant on which destinies hang. Pitou seized it.
"Mademoiselle, I returned to France only this evening. All the journey my thought was--to see
you as soon as I arrived!"
"Your friend," she said, with a scornful glance towards de Fronsac, who sauntered gracefully
away, "would warn you that you are rash."
"I am not afraid of his warning."
"Are you not afraid of _me_?"
"Afraid only that you will banish me too soon."
"Mon Dieu! then you must be the bravest man in Paris," she said.
"At any rate I am the luckiest for the moment."
It was a delightful change to Florozonde to meet a man who was not alarmed by her; and it
pleased her to show de Fronsac that his cowardice had not left her inconsolable. She laughed
loud enough for him to hear.
"I ought not to be affording you the luck," she answered. "I have friends waiting for me at the
Café de Paris." "I expected some such blow," said Pitou. "And how can I suppose you will
disappoint your friends in order to sup with me at the Café du Bel Avenir instead?"
"The Café du--?" She was puzzled.
"Bel Avenir."
"I do not know it."
"Nor would your coachman. We should walk there--and our supper would cost three francs,
wine included."
"Is it an invitation?"
"It is a prayer."

"Who are you?"
"My name is Nicolas Pitou,"
"Of Paris?"
"Of bohemia."
"What do you do in it?"
"Hunger, and make music."
"Unsuccessful?"
"Not to-night!"
"Take me to the Bel Avenir," she said, and sent the carriage away.
De Fronsac, looking back as they departed, was distressed to see the young man risking his
life.
At the Bel Avenir their entrance made a sensation. She removed her cloak, and Pitou arranged
it over two chairs. Then she threw her gloves out of the way, in the bread-basket; and the waiter
and the proprietress, and all the family, did homage to her toilette.
"Who would have supposed?" she smiled, and her smile forgot to be mysterious.
"That the restaurant would be so proud?"
"That I should be supping with you in it! Tell me, you had no hope of this on your journey? It was
true about your journey, hein?"
"Ah, really! No, how could I hope? I went round after your dance simply to see you closer; and
then I met de Fronsac, and then--"
"And then you were very cheeky. Answer! Why do I interest you? Because of what they say of
me?"
"Not altogether."
"What else?"
"Because you are so beautiful. Answer! Why did you come to supper with me? To annoy some
other fellow?"
"Not altogether."
"What else?"

"Because you were not frightened of me. Are you sure you are not frightened? Oh, remember,
remember your horrible fate if I should like you too much!"
"It would be a thumping advertisement for you," said Pitou. "Let me urge you to try to secure it."
"Reckless boy!" she laughed, "Pour out some more wine. Ah, it is good, this! it is like old times.
The strings of onions on the dear, dirty walls, and the serviettes that are so nice and damp! It
was in restaurants like this, if my salary was paid, I used to sup on fête days."
"And if it was not paid?"
"I supped in imagination. My dear, I have had a cigarette for a supper, and the grass for a bed. I
have tramped by the caravan while the stars faded, and breakfasted on the drum in the tent.
And you--on a bench in the Champs Elysées, hein?"
"It has occurred."
"And you watched the sun rise, and made music, and wished _you_ could rise, too? I must hear
your music some day. You shall write me a dance. Is it agreed?"
"The contract is already stamped," said Pitou.
"I am glad I met you--it is the best supper I have had in Paris. Why are you calculating the
expenses on the back of the bill of fare?"
"I am not. I am composing your dance," said Pitou. "Don't speak for a minute, it will be sublime!
Also it will be a souvenir when you have gone."
But she did not go for a long while. It was late when they left the Café du Bel Avenir, still
talking--and there was always more to say. By this time Pitou did not merely love her beauty--he
adored the woman. As for Florozonde, she no longer merely loved his courage--she approved
the man.
Listen: he was young, fervid, and an artist; his proposal was made before they reached her
doorstep, and she consented!
Their attachment was the talk of the town, and everybody waited to hear that Pitou had killed
himself. His name was widely known at last. But weeks and months went by; Florozonde's
protracted season came to an end; and still he looked radiantly well. Pitou was the most
unpopular man in Paris.
In the rue Dauphine, one day, he met de Fronsac.
"So you are still alive!" snarled the poet.
"Never better," declared Pitou. "It turns out," he added confidentially, "there was nothing in that
story--it was all fudge."
"Evidently! I must congratulate you," said de Fronsac, looking bomb-shells.

THE OPPORTUNITY OF PETITPAS
In Bordeaux, on the 21st of December, monsieur Petitpas, a clerk with bohemian yearnings,
packed his portmanteau for a week's holiday. In Paris, on the same date, monsieur Tricotrin,
poet and pauper, was commissioned by the Editor of _Le Demi-Mot_ to convert a rough
translation into literary French. These two disparate incidents were destined by Fate--always
mysterious in her workings--to be united in a narrative for the present volume.
Three evenings later the poet's concierge climbed the stairs and rapped peremptorily at the
door.
"Well?" cried Tricotrin, raising bloodshot eyes from the manuscript; "who disturbs me now?
Come in!"
"I have come in," panted madame Dubois, who had not waited for his invitation, "and I am here
to tell you, monsieur, that you cannot be allowed to groan in this agonised fashion. Your
lamentations can be heard even in the basement."
"Is it in my agreement, madame, that I shall not groan if I am so disposed?" inquired the poet
haughtily.
"There are things tacitly understood. It is enough that you are in arrears with your rent, without
your doing your best to drive away the other tenants. For two days they have all complained
that it would be less disturbing to reside in a hospital."
"Well, they have my permission to remove there," said Tricotrin. "Now that the matter is settled,
let me get on with my work!" And with the groan of a soul in Hades, he perused another line.
"There you go again!" expostulated the woman angrily, "It is not to be endured, monsieur. What
is the matter with you, for goodness' sake?"
"With me, madame, there is nothing the matter; the fault lies with an infernal Spanish novel. A
misguided editor has commissioned me to rewrite it from a translation made by a foreigner. How
can I avoid groans when I read his rot? Miranda exclaims, 'May heaven confound you, bandit!'
And the fiancé of the ingénue addresses her as 'Angel of this house!'"
"Well, at least groan quietly," begged the concierge; "do not bellow your sufferings to the cellar."
"To oblige you I will be as Spartan as I can," agreed Tricotrin. "Now I have lost my place in the
masterpiece. Ah, here we are! 'I feel she brings bad tidings--she wears a disastrous mien.' It is
sprightly dialogue! If the hundred and fifty francs were not essential to keep a roof over my
head, I would send the Editor a challenge for offering me the job."
Perspiration bespangled the young man's brow as he continued his task. When another hour
had worn by he thirsted to do the foreign translator a bodily injury, and so intense was his
exasperation that, by way of interlude, he placed the manuscript on the floor and jumped on it.
But the climax was reached in Chapter XXVII; under the provocation of the love scene in
Chapter XXVII frenzy mastered him, and with a yell of torture he hurled the whole novel through
the window, and burst into hysterical tears.

The novel, which was of considerable bulk, descended on the landlord, who was just
approaching the house to collect his dues.
"What does it mean," gasped monsieur Gouge, when he had recovered his equilibrium, and his
hat; "what does it mean that I cannot approach my own property without being assaulted with a
ton of paper? Who has dared to throw such a thing from a window?"
"Monsieur," stammered the concierge, "I do not doubt that it was the top-floor poet; he has been
behaving like a lunatic for days."
"Aha, the top-floor poet?" snorted monsieur Gouge. "I shall soon dispose of _him_!" And
Tricotrin's tears were scarcely dried when _bang_ came another knock at his door.
"So, monsieur," exclaimed the landlord, with fine satire, "your poems are of small account, it
appears, since you use them as missiles? The value you put upon your scribbling does not
encourage me to wait for my rent!"
"Mine?" faltered Tricotrin, casting an indignant glance at the muddy manuscript restored to him;
"you accuse _me_ of having perpetrated that atrocity? Oh, this is too much! I have a reputation
to preserve, monsieur, and I swear by all the Immortals that it was no work of mine."
"Did you not throw it?"
"Throw it? Yes, assuredly I threw it. But I did not write it."
"Morbleu! what do I care who wrote it?" roared monsieur Gouge, purple with spleen. "Does its
authorship improve the condition of my hat? My grievance is its arrival on my head, not its
literary quality. Let me tell you that you expose yourself to actions at law, pitching weights like
this from a respectable house into a public street."
"I should plead insanity," said Tricotrin; "twenty-seven chapters of that novel, translated into a
Spaniard's French, would suffice to people an asylum. Nevertheless, if it arrived on your hat, I
owe you an apology."
"You also owe me two hundred francs!" shouted the other, "and I have shown you more
patience than you deserve. Well, my folly is finished! You settle up, or you get out, right off!"
"Have you reflected that it is Christmas Eve--do we live in a melodrama, that I should wander
homeless on Christmas Eve? Seriously, you cannot expect a man of taste to lend himself to so
hackneyed a situation? Besides, I share this apartment with the composer monsieur Nicolas
Pitou. Consider how poignant he would find the room's associations if he returned to dwell here
alone!"
"Monsieur Pitou will not be admitted when he returns--there is not a pin to choose between the
pair of you. You hand me the two hundred francs, or you go this minute--and I shall detain your
wardrobe till you pay. Where is it?"
"It is divided between my person and a shelf at the pawnbroker's," explained the poet; "but I
have a soiled collar in the left-hand corner drawer. However, I can offer you more valuable

security for this trifling debt than you would dare to ask; the bureau is full of pearls --metrical, but
beyond price. I beg your tenderest care of them, especially my tragedy in seven acts. Do not
play jinks with the contents of that bureau, or Posterity will gibbet you and the name of 'Gouge'
will one day be execrated throughout France. Garbage, farewell!"
"Here, take your shaving paper with you!" cried monsieur Gouge, flinging the Spanish novel
down the stairs. And the next moment the man of letters stood dejected on the pavement, with
the fatal manuscript under his arm.
"Ah, Miranda, Miranda, thou little knowest what mischief thou hast done!" he murmured,
unconsciously plagiarising. "She brought bad tidings indeed, with her disastrous mien," he
added. "What is to become of me now?"
The moon, to which he had naturally addressed this query, made no answer; and, fingering the
sou in his trouser-pocket, he trudged in the direction of the rue Ravignan. "The situation would
look well in print," he reflected, "but the load under my arm should, dramatically, be a bundle of
my own poems. Doubtless the matter will be put right by my biographer. I wonder if I can get
half a bed from Goujaud?"
Encouraged by the thought of the painter's hospitality, he proceeded to the studio; but he was
informed in sour tones that monsieur Goujaud would not sleep there that night.
"So much the better," he remarked, "for I can have all his bed, instead of half of it! Believe me, I
shall put you to no trouble, madame."
"I believe it fully," answered the woman, "for you will not come inside--not monsieur Goujaud,
nor you, nor any other of his vagabond friends. So, there!"
"Ah, is that how the wind blows--the fellow has not paid his rent?" said Tricotrin. "How
disgraceful of him, to be sure! Fortunately Sanquereau lives in the next house."
He pulled the bell there forthwith, and the peal had scarcely sounded when Sanquereau rushed
to the door, crying, "Welcome, my Beautiful!"
"Mon Dieu, what worthless acquaintances I possess!" moaned the unhappy poet. "Since you
are expecting your Beautiful I need not go into details."
"What on earth did you want?" muttered Sanquereau, crestfallen.
"I came to tell you the latest Stop Press news--Goujaud's landlord has turned him out and I have
no bed to lie on. Au revoir!"
After another apostrophe to the heavens, "That inane moon, which makes no response, is
beginning to get on my nerves," he soliloquised. "Let me see now! There is certainly master
Criqueboeuf, but it is a long journey to the quartier Latin, and when I get there his social
engagements may annoy me as keenly as Sanquereau's. It appears to me I am likely to try the
open-air cure to-night. In the meanwhile I may as well find Miranda a seat and think things
over."

Accordingly he bent his steps to the place Dancourt, and having deposited the incubus beside
him, stretched his limbs on a bench beneath a tree. His attitude, and his luxuriant locks, to say
nothing of his melancholy aspect, rendered him a noticeable figure in the little square, and
monsieur Petitpas, from Bordeaux, under the awning of the café opposite, stood regarding him
with enthusiasm.
"Upon my word of honour," mused Petitpas, rubbing his hands, "I believe I see a Genius in the
dumps! At last I behold the Paris of my dreams. If I have read my Murger to any purpose, I am
on the verge of an epoch. What a delightful adventure!"
Taking out his Marylands, Petitpas sauntered towards the bench with a great show of
carelessness, and made a pretence of feeling in his pockets for a match. "Tschut!" he
exclaimed; then, affecting to observe Tricotrin for the first time, "May I beg you to oblige me with
a light, monsieur?" he asked deferentially. A puff of wind provided an excuse for sitting down to
guard the flame; and the next moment the Genius had accepted a cigarette, and acknowledged
that the weather was mild for the time of year.
Excitement thrilled Petitpas. How often, after business hours, he had perused his well-thumbed
copy of _La Vie de Bohème_ and in fancy consorted with the gay descendants of Rodolphe and
Marcel; how often he had regretted secretly that he, himself, did not woo a Muse and jest at
want in a garret, instead of totting up figures, and eating three meals a day in comfort! And now
positively one of the fascinating beings of his imagination lolled by his side! The little clerk on a
holiday longed to play the generous comrade. In his purse he had a couple of louis, designed
for sight-seeing, and, with a rush of emotion, he pictured himself squandering five or six francs
in half an hour and startling the artist by his prodigality.
"If I am not mistaken, I have the honour to address an author, monsieur?" he ventured.
"Your instincts have not misled you," replied the poet; "I am Tricotrin, monsieur--Gustave
Tricotrin. The name, however, is to be found, as yet, on no statues."
"My own name," said the clerk, "is Adolphe Petitpas. I am a stranger in Paris, and I count myself
fortunate indeed to have made monsieur Tricotrin's acquaintance so soon."
"He expresses himself with some discretion, this person," reflected Tricotrin. "And his cigarette
was certainly providential!"
"To meet an author has always been an ambition of mine," Petitpas continued; "I dare to say
that I have the artistic temperament, though circumstances have condemned me to commercial
pursuits. You have no idea how enviable the literary life appears to me, monsieur!"
"Its privileges are perhaps more monotonous than you suppose," drawled the homeless poet.
"Also, I had to work for many years before I attained my present position."
"This noble book, for instance," began the clerk, laying a reverent hand on the abominable
manuscript.
"Hein?" exclaimed its victim, starting.
 33 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
"To have written this noble book must be a joy compared with which my own prosperity is
valueless."
"The damned thing is no work of mine," cried Tricotrin; "and if we are to avoid a quarrel, I will
ask you not to accuse me of it! A joy, indeed? In that block of drivel you view the cause of my
deepest misfortunes."
"A thousand apologies!" stammered his companion; "my inference was hasty. But what you say
interests me beyond words. This manuscript, of seeming innocence, is the cause of
misfortunes? May I crave an enormous favour; may I beg you to regard me as a friend and give
me your confidence?"
"I see no reason why I should refuse it," answered Tricotrin, on whom
the boast of "prosperity" had made a deep impression. "You must know, then, that this
ineptitude, inflicted on me by an eccentric editor for translation, drove me to madness, and not
an hour ago I cast it from my window in disgust. It is a novel entirely devoid of taste and tact,
and it had the clumsiness to alight on my landlord's head. Being a man of small nature, he
retaliated by demanding his rent."
"Which it was not convenient to pay?" interrupted Petitpas, all the pages of _La Vie de
Bohème_ playing leapfrog through his brain.
"I regret to bore you by so trite a situation. 'Which it was not convenient to pay'! Indeed, I was
not responsible for all of it, for I occupied the room with a composer named Pitou. Well, you can
construct the next scene without a collaborator; the landlord has a speech, and the tragedy is
entitled 'Tricotrin in Quest of a Home.'"
"What of the composer?" inquired the delighted clerk; "what has become of monsieur Pitou?"
"Monsieur Pitou was not on in that Act. The part of Pitou will attain prominence when he returns
and finds himself locked out."
"But, my dear monsieur Tricotrin, in such an extremity you should have sought the services of a
friend."
"I had that inspiration myself; I sought a painter called Goujaud. And observe how careless is
Reality in the matter of coincidences! I learnt from his concierge that precisely the same thing
had befallen monsieur Goujaud. He, too, is Christmassing alfresco."
"Mon Dieu," faltered the clerk, "how it rejoices me that I have met you! All my life I have looked
forward to encountering a genius in such a fix."
"Alas!" sighed Tricotrin, with a pensive smile, "to the genius the fix is less spicy. Without a
supper--"
"Without a supper!" crowed Petitpas.

"Without a bed--"
"Without a bed!" babbled Petitpas, enravished.
"With nothing but a pen and the sacred fire, one may be forgiven sadness."
"Not so, not so," shouted Petitpas, smacking him on the back. "You are omitting _me_ from your
list of assets! Listen, I am staying at an hotel. You cannot decline to accord me the honour of
welcoming you there as my guest for the night. Hang the expense! I am no longer in business, I
am a bohemian, like yourself; some supper, a bed, and a little breakfast will not ruin me. What
do you say, monsieur?"
"I say, drop the 'monsieur,' old chap," responded Tricotrin. "Your suggestions for the tragedy are
cordially accepted. I have never known a collaborator to improve a plot so much. And
understand this: I feel more earnestly than I speak; henceforth we are pals, you and I."
"Brothers!" cried Petitpas, in ecstasy. "You shall hear all about a novel that I have projected for
years. I should like to have your opinion of it."
"I shall be enchanted," said Tricotrin, his jaw dropping.
"You must introduce me to your circle--the painters, and the models, and the actresses. Your
friends shall be _my_ friends in future."
"Don't doubt it! When I tell them what a brick you are, they will be proud to know you."
"No ceremony, mind!"
"Not a bit. You shall be another chum. Already I feel as if we had been confidants in our
cradles."
"It is the same with me. How true it is that kindred spirits recognise each other in an instant.
What is environment? Bah! A man may be a bohemian and an artist although his occupations
are commercial?"
"Perfectly! I nearly pined amid commercial occupations myself."
"What an extraordinary coincidence! Ah, that is the last bond between us! You can realise my
most complex moods, you can penetrate to the most distant suburbs of my soul! Gustave, if I
had been free to choose my career, I should have become a famous man." "My poor Adolphe!
Still, prosperity is not an unmixed evil. You must seek compensation in your wealth," murmured
the poet, who began to think that one might pay too high a price for a bed.
"Oh--er--to be sure!" said the little clerk, reminded that he was pledged to a larger outlay than he
had originally proposed. "That is to say, I am not precisely 'wealthy.'" He saw his pocket-money
during the trip much curtailed, and rather wished that his impulse had been less expansive.
"A snug income is no stigma, whether one derives it from Parnassus or the Bourse," continued
Tricotrin. "Hold! Who is that I see, slouching over there? As I live, it's Pitou, the composer,
 35 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
whose dilemma I told you of!"
"Another?" quavered the clerk, dismayed.
"Hé, Nicolas! Turn your symphonic gaze this way! 'Tis I, Gustave!"
"Ah, mon vieux!" exclaimed the young musician joyfully; "I was wondering what your fate might
be. I have only just come from the house. Madame Dubois refused me admission; she informed
me that you had been firing Spanish novels at Gouge's head. Why Spanish? Is the Spanish
variety deadlier? So the villain has had the effrontery to turn us out?"
"Let me make your affinities known to each other," said Tricotrin. "My brother Nicolas--my
brother Adolphe. Brother Adolphe has received a scenario of the tragedy already, and he has a
knack of inventing brilliant 'curtains.'"
Behind Pitou's back he winked at Petitpas, as if to say, "He little suspects what a surprise you
have in store for him!"
"Oh--er--I am grieved to hear of your trouble, monsieur Pitou," said Petitpas feebly.
"What? 'Grieved'? Come, that isn't all about it!" cried Tricotrin, who attributed his restraint to
nothing but diffidence. In an undertone he added, "Don't be nervous, dear boy. Your invitation
won't offend him in the least!"
Petitpas breathed heavily. He aspired to prove himself a true bohemian, but his heart quailed at
the thought of such expense. Two suppers, two beds, and two little breakfasts as a supplement
to his bill would be no joke. It was with a very poor grace that he stammered at last, "I hope you
will allow me to suggest a way out, monsieur Pitou? A room at my hotel seems to dispose of the
difficulty."
"Hem?" exclaimed Pitou. "Is that room a mirage, or are you serious?"
"'Serious'?" echoed Tricotrin. "He is as serious as an English adaptation of a French farce." He
went on, under his breath, "You mustn't judge him by his manner, I can see that he has turned a
little shy. Believe me, he is the King of Trumps."
"Well, upon my word I shall be delighted, monsieur," responded Pitou. "It was evidently the
good kind fairies that led me to the place Dancourt. I would ask you to step over the way and
have a bock, but my finances forbid."
"Your finances need cause no drought--Adolphe will be paymaster!" declared Tricotrin gaily,
shouldering his manuscript. "Come, let us adjourn and give the Réveillon its due!"
Petitpas suppressed a moan. "By all means," he assented; "I was about to propose it myself. I
am a real bohemian, you know, and think nothing of ordering several bocks at once."
"Are you sure he is all you say?" whispered Pitou to Tricotrin, with misgiving.
"A shade embarrassed, that is all," pronounced the poet. And then, as the trio moved arm-in-
 36 / 166

arm toward the café, a second solitary figure emerged from the obscurity of the square.
"Bless my soul!" ejaculated Tricotrin; "am I mistaken, or--Look, look, Adolphe! I would bet ten to
one in sonnets that it is Goujaud, the painter, whose plight I mentioned to you!"
"Yet another?" gasped Petitpas, panic-stricken.
"Sst! Hé, Goujaud! Come here, you vagrant, and be entertaining!"
"Well met, you fellows!" sighed Goujaud. "Where are you off to?"
"We are going to give Miranda a drink," said the poet; "she is drier than ever. Let there be no
strangers--my brother Adolphe, my brother Théodose! What is your secret woe, Théo? Your
face is as long as this Spaniard's novel, Adolphe, have you a recipe in your pocket for the
hump?"
"Perhaps monsieur Goujaud will join us in a glass of beer?" said Petitpas very coldly.
"There are more unlikely things than that!" affirmed the painter; and when the café was entered,
he swallowed his bock like one who has a void to fill. "The fact is," he confided to the group, "I
was about to celebrate the Réveillon on a bench. That insolent landlord of mine has kicked me
out."
"And you will not get inside," said Tricotrin, "'not you, nor I, nor any other of your vagabond
friends. So there!' I had the privilege of conversing with your concierge earlier in the evening."
"Ah, then, you know all about it. Well, now that I have run across you, you can give me a
shakedown in your attic. Good business!"
"I discern only one drawback to the scheme," said Pitou; "we haven't any attic. It must be
something in the air--all the landlords seem to have the same complaint."
"But if you decide in the bench's favour, after all, you may pillow your curls on Miranda," put in
Tricotrin. "She would be exhilarating company for him, Adolphe, hein? What do you think?" He
murmured aside, "Give him a dig in the ribs and say, 'You silly ass, _I_ can fix you up all right!'
That's the way we issue invitations in Montmartre."
The clerk's countenance was livid; his tongue stuck to his front teeth. At last, wrenching the
words out, he groaned, "If monsieur Goujaud will accept my hospitality, I shall be charmed!" He
was not without a hope that his frigid bearing would beget a refusal.
"Ah, my dear old chap!" shouted Goujaud without an instant's hesitation, "consider it done!" And
now there were to be three suppers, three beds, and three little breakfasts, distorting the
account!
Petitpas sipped his bock faintly, affecting not to notice that his guests' glasses had been
emptied. With all his soul he repented the impulse that had led to his predicament. Amid the
throes of his mental arithmetic he recognised that he had been deceived in himself, that he had
no abiding passion for bohemia. How much more pleasing than to board and lodge this
 37 / 166

disreputable collection would have been the daily round of amusements that he had planned!
Even now--he caught his breath--even now it was not too late; he might pay for the drinks and
escape! Why shouldn't he run away?
"Gentlemen," cried Petitpas, "I shall go and fetch a cab for us all. Make yourselves comfortable
till I come back!"
When the café closed, messieurs Tricotrin, Goujaud, and Pitou crept forlornly across the square
and disposed themselves for slumber on the bench.
"Well, there is this to be said," yawned the poet, "if the little bounder had kept his word, it would
have been an extraordinary conclusion to our adventures--as persons of literary discretion, we
can hardly regret that a story did not end so improbably.... My children, Miranda, goodnight--and a Merry Christmas!"
THE CAFÉ OF THE BROKEN HEART
On the last day of the year, towards the dinner-hour, a young and attractive woman, whose
costume proclaimed her a widow, entered the Café of the Broken Heart. That modest restaurant
is situated near the Cemetery of Mont-martre. The lady, quoting from an announcement over
the window, requested the proprietor to conduct her to the "Apartment reserved for Those
Desirous of Weeping Alone."
The proprietor's shoulders became apologetic. "A thousand regrets, madame," he murmured;
"the Weeping Alone apartment is at present occupied."
This visibly annoyed the customer.
"It is the second anniversary of my bereavement," she complained, "and already I have wept
here twice. The woe of an habituée should find a welcome!"
Her reproof, still more her air of being well-to-do, had an effect on Brochat. He looked at his
wife, and his wife said hesitatingly:
"Perhaps the young man would consent to oblige madame if you asked him nicely. After all, he
engaged the room for seven o'clock, and it is not yet half-past six."
"That is true," said Brochat. "Alors, I shall see what can be arranged! I beg that madame will put
herself to the trouble of sitting down while I make the biggest endeavours."
But he returned after a few minutes to declare that the young man's sorrow was so profound
that no reply could be extracted from him.
The lady showed signs of temper. "Has this person the monopoly of sorrowing on your
premises?" she demanded. "Whom does he lament? Surely the loss of a husband should give
me prior claim?"
"I cannot rightly say whom the gentleman laments," stammered Brochat; "the circumstances
are, in fact, somewhat unusual. I would mention, however, that the apartment is a spacious one,
 38 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
as madame doubtless recalls, and no further mourners are expected for half an hour. If in the
meantime madame would be so amiable as to weep in the young man's presence, I can assure
her that she would find him too stricken to stare."
The widow considered. "Well," she said, after the pause, "if you can guarantee his abstraction,
so be it! It is a matter of conscience with me to behave in precisely the same way each year,
and, rather than miss my meditations there altogether, I am willing to make the best of him."
Brochat, having taken her order for refreshments--for which he always charged slightly higher
prices on the first floor--preceded her up the stairs. The single gas-flame that had been kindled
in the room was very low, and the lady received but a momentary impression of a man's figure
bowed over a white table. She chose a chair at once with her back towards him, and resting her
brow on her forefinger, disposed herself for desolation.
It may have been that the stranger's proximity told on her nerves, or it may have been that Time
had done something to heal the wound. Whatever the cause, the frame of mind that she invited
was slow in arriving, and when the bouillon and biscottes appeared she was not averse from
trifling with them. Meanwhile, for any sound that he had made, the young man might have been
as defunct as Henri IV; but as she took her second sip, a groan of such violence escaped him
that she nearly upset her cup.
His abandonment of despair seemed to reflect upon her own insensibility; and, partly to raise
herself in his esteem, the lady a moment later uttered a long-drawn, wistful sigh. No sooner had
she done so, however, than she deeply regretted the indiscretion, for it stimulated the young
man to a howl positively harrowing.
An impatient movement of her graceful shoulders protested against these demonstrations, but
as she had her back to him, she could not tell whether he observed her. Stealing a glance, she
discovered that his face was buried in his hands, and that the white table seemed to be laid for
ten covers. Scrutiny revealed ten bottles of wine around it, the neck of each bottle embellished
with a large crape bow. Curiosity now held the lady wide-eyed, and, as luck would have it, the
young man, at this moment, raised his head.
"I trust that my agony does not disturb you, madame?" he inquired, meeting her gaze with some
embarrassment.
"I must confess, monsieur," said she, "that you have been carrying it rather far."
He accepted the rebuke humbly. "If you divined the intensity of my sufferings, you would be
lenient," he murmured. "Nevertheless, it was dishonest of me to moan so bitterly before seven
o'clock, when my claim to the room legally begins. I entreat your pardon."
"It is accorded freely," said the lady, mollified by his penitence. "She would be a poor mourner
who quarrelled with the affliction of another."
Again she indulged in a plaintive sigh, and this time the young man's response was tactfully
harmonious.
"Life is a vale of tears, madame," he remarked, with more solicitude than originality.

"You may indeed say so, monsieur," she assented. "To have lost one who was beloved--"
"It must be a heavy blow; I can imagine it!"
He had made a curious answer. She stared at him, perplexed.
"You can 'imagine' it?"
"Very well."
"But you yourself have experienced such a loss, monsieur?" faltered the widow nervously. Had
trouble unhinged his brain?
"No," said the young man; "to speak by the clock, my own loss has not yet occurred."
A brief silence fell, during which she cast uneasy glances towards the door.
He added, as if anxious that she should do him justice: "But I would not have you consider my
lamentations premature."
"How true it is," breathed the lady, "that in this world no human soul can wholly comprehend
another!"
"Mine is a very painful history," he warned her, taking the hint; "yet if it will serve to divert your
mind from your own misfortune, I shall be honoured to confide it to you. Stay, the tenth
invitation, which an accident prevented my dispatching, would explain the circumstances
tersely: but I much fear that the room is too dark for you to decipher all the subtleties. Have I
your permission to turn up the gas?"
"Do so, by all means, monsieur," said the lady graciously. And the light displayed to her, first, as
personable a young man as she could have desired to see; second, an imposing card, which
was inscribed as follows:
MONSIEUR ACHILLE FLAMANT, ARTIST,
Forewarns you of the
DEATH OF HIS CAREER
The Interment will take place at the Café of the Broken Heart
on December 31st.
_Valedictory N.B.--A sympathetic costume Victuals will be appreciated. 7 p.m._
"I would call your attention to the border of cypress, and to the tomb in the corner," said the
young man, with melancholy pride. "You may also look favourably on the figure with the shovel,
which, of course, depicts me in the act of burying my hopes. It is a symbolic touch that no hope
is visible."

"It is a very artistic production altogether," said the widow, dissembling her astonishment. "So
you are a painter, monsieur Flamant?"
"Again speaking by the clock, I am a painter," he concurred; "but at midnight I shall no longer be
in a position to say so--in the morning I am pledged to the life commercial. You will not marvel at
my misery when I inform you that the existence of Achille Flamant, the artist, will terminate in
five hours and twenty odd minutes!"
"Well, I am commercial myself," she said. "I am madame Aurore, the Beauty Specialist, of the
rue Baba. Do not think me wanting in the finer emotions, but I assure you that a lucrative
establishment is not a calamity."
"Madame Aurore," demurred the painter, with a bow, "your own business is but a sister art. In
your atelier, the saffron of a bad complexion blooms to the fairness of a rose, and the bunch of
a lumpy figure is modelled to the grace of Galatea. With me it will be a different pair of shoes; I
shall be condemned to perch on a stool in the office of a wine-merchant, and invoice vintages
which my thirty francs a week will not allow me to drink. No comparison can be drawn between
your lot and my little."
"Certainly I should not like to perch," she confessed.
"Would you rejoice at the thirty francs a week?"
"Well, and the thirty francs a week are also poignant. But you may rise, monsieur; who shall
foretell the future? Once I had to make both ends meet with less to coax them than the salary
you mention. Even when my poor husband was taken from me--heigho!" she raised a miniature
handkerchief delicately to her eyes--"when I was left alone in the world, monsieur, my affairs
were greatly involved--I had practically nothing but my resolve to succeed."
"And the witchery of your personal attractions, madame," said the painter politely.
"Ah!" A pensive smile rewarded him. "The business was still in its infancy, monsieur; yet to-day I
have the smartest clientèle in Paris. I might remove to the rue de la Paix to-morrow if I pleased.
But, I say, why should I do that? I say, why a reckless rental for the sake of a fashionable
address, when the fashionable men and women come to me where I am?"
"You show profound judgment, madame," said Flamant. "Why, indeed!"
"And you, too, will show good judgment, I am convinced," continued madame Aurore, regarding
him with approval. "You have an air of intellect. If your eyebrows were elongated a fraction
towards the temples--an improvement that might be effected easily enough by regular use of my
Persian Pomade--you would acquire the appearance of a born conqueror."
"Alas," sighed Flamant, "my finances forbid my profiting by the tip!"
"Monsieur, you wrong me," murmured the specialist reproachfully. "I was speaking with no
professional intent. On the contrary, if you will permit me, I shall take joy in forwarding a pot to
you gratis."

"Is it possible?" cried Flamant: "you would really do this for me? You feel for my sufferings so
much?"
"Indeed, I regret that I cannot persuade you to reduce the sufferings," she replied. "But tell me
why you have selected the vocation of a wine-merchant's clerk."
"Fate, not I, has determined my cul-de-sac in life," rejoined her companion. "It is like this: my
father, who lacks an artistic soul, consented to my becoming a painter only upon the
understanding that I should gain the Prix de Rome and pursue my studies in Italy free of any
expense to him. This being arranged, he agreed to make me a minute allowance in the
meanwhile. By a concatenation of catastrophes upon which it is unnecessary to dwell, the
Beaux-Arts did not accord the prize to me; and, at the end of last year, my parent reminded me
of our compact, with a vigour which nothing but the relationship prevents my describing as
'inhuman'. He insisted that I must bid farewell to aspiration and renounce the brush of an artist
for the quill of a clerk! Distraught, I flung myself upon my knees. I implored him to reconsider.
My tribulation would have moved a rock--it even moved his heart!"
"He showed you mercy?"
"He allowed me a respite."
"It was for twelve months?"
"Precisely. What rapid intuitions you have!--if I could remain in Paris, we should become great
friends. He allowed me twelve months' respite. If, at the end of that time, Art was still inadequate
to supply my board and lodging, it was covenanted that, without any more ado, I should resign
myself to clerical employment at Nantes. The merchant there is a friend of the family, and had
offered to demonstrate his friendship by paying me too little to live on. Enfin, Fame has
continued coy. The year expires to-night. I have begged a few comrades to attend a valedictory
dinner--and at the stroke of midnight, despairing I depart!"
"Is there a train?"
"I do not depart from Paris till after breakfast to-morrow; but at midnight I depart from myself, I
depart psychologically--the Achille Flamant of the Hitherto will be no more."
"I understand," said madame Aurore, moved. "As you say, in my own way I am an artist, too,
there is a bond between us. Poor fellow, it is indeed a crisis in your life!... Who put the crape
bows on the bottles? they are badly tied. Shall I tie them properly for you?"
"It would be a sweet service," said Flamant, "and I should be grateful. How gentle you are to
me--pomade, bows, nothing is too much for you!"
"You must give me your Nantes address," she said, "and I will post the pot without fail."
"I shall always keep it," he vowed--"not the pomade, but the pot--as a souvenir. Will you write a
few lines to me at the same time?"
Her gaze was averted; she toyed with her spoon. "The directions will be on the label," she said

timidly.
"It was not of my eyebrows I was thinking," murmured the man.
"What should I say? The latest quotation for artificial lashes, or a development in dimple culture,
would hardly be engrossing to you."
"I am inclined to believe that anything that concerned you would engross me."
"It would be so unconventional," she objected dreamily.
"To send a brief message of encouragement? Have we not talked like confidants?"
"That is queerer still."
"I admit it. Just now I was unaware of your existence, and suddenly you dominate my thoughts.
How do you work these miracles, madame? Do you know that I have an enormous favour to
crave of you?"
"What, another one?"
"Actually! Is it not audacious of me? Yet for a man on the verge of parting from his identity, I
venture to hope that you will strain a point."
"The circumstances are in the man's favour," she owned. "Nevertheless, much depends on
what the point is."
"Well, I ask nothing less than that you accept the invitation on the card that you examined; I beg
you to soothe my last hours by remaining to dine."
"Oh, but really," she exclaimed. "I am afraid--"
"You cannot urge that you are required at your atelier so late. And as to any social engagement,
I do not hesitate to affirm that my approaching death in life puts forth the stronger claim."
"On me? When all is said, a new acquaintance!"
"What is Time?" demanded the painter. And she was not prepared with a reply.
"Your comrades will be strangers to me," she argued.
"It is a fact that now I wish they were not coming," acknowledged the host; "but they are young
men of the loftiest genius, and some day it may provide a piquant anecdote to relate how you
met them all in the period of their obscurity."
"My friend," she said, hurt, "if I consented, it would not be to garner anecdotes."
"Ah, a million regrets!" he cried; "I spoke foolishly."

"It was tactless."
"Yes--I am a man. Do you forgive?"
"Yes--I am a woman. Well, I must take my bonnet off!"
"Oh, you are not a woman, but an angel! What beautiful hair you have! And your hands, how I
should love to paint them!"
"I have painted them, myself--with many preparations. My hands have known labour, believe
me; they have washed up plates and dishes, and often the dishes had provided little to eat."
"Poor girl! One would never suspect that you had struggled like that."
"How feelingly you say it! There have been few to show me sympathy. Oh, I assure you, my life
has been a hard one; it is a hard one now, in spite of my success. Constantly, when customers
moan before my mirrors, I envy them, if they did but know it. I think: 'Yes, you have a double
chin, and your eyes have lost their fire, and nasty curly little veins are spoiling the pallor of your
nose; but you have the affection of husband and child, while _I_ have nothing but fees.' What is
my destiny? To hear great-grandmothers grumble because I cannot give them back their
girlhood for a thousand francs! To devote myself to making other women beloved, while _I_
remain loveless in my shop!"
"Honestly, my heart aches for you. If I might presume to advise, I would say, 'Do not allow the
business to absorb your youth--you were meant to be worshipped.' And yet, while I recommend
it, I hate to think of another man worshipping you."
"Why should you care, my dear? But there is no likelihood of that; I am far too busy to seek
worshippers. A propos an idea has just occurred to me which might be advantageous to us
both. If you could inform your father that you would be able to earn rather more next year by
remaining in Paris than by going to Nantes, would it be satisfactory?"
"Satisfactory?" ejaculated Flamant. "It would be ecstatic! But how shall I acquire such
information?"
"Would you like to paint a couple of portraits of me?"
"I should like to paint a thousand."
"My establishment is not a picture-gallery. Listen. I offer you a commission for two portraits: one,
present day, let us say, moderately attractive--"
"I decline to libel you."
"O, flatterer! The other, depicting my faded aspect before I discovered the priceless secrets of
the treatment that I practise in the rue Baba. I shall hang them both in the reception-room. I
must look at least a decade older in the 'Before' than in the 'After,' and it must, of course,
present the appearance of having been painted some years ago. That can be faked?"

"Perfectly."
"You accept?" "I embrace your feet. You have saved my life; you have preserved my
hopefulness, you have restored my youth!"
"It is my profession to preserve and restore."
"Ah, mon Dieu!" gasped Flamant in a paroxysm of adoration. "Aurore, I can no longer refrain
from avowing that--"
At this instant the door opened, and there entered solemnly nine young men, garbed in such
habiliments of woe as had never before been seen perambulating, even on the figures of
undertakers. The foremost bore a wreath of immortelles, which he laid in devout silence on the
dinner-table.
"Permit me," said Flamant, recovering himself by a stupendous effort: "monsieur Tricotrin, the
poet--madame Aurore."
"Enchanted!" said the poet, in lugubrious tones. "I have a heavy cold, thank you, owing to my
having passed the early hours of Christmas Day on a bench, in default of a bed. It is
superfluous to inquire as to the health of madame."
"Monsieur Goujaud, a colleague."
"Overjoyed!" responded Goujaud, with a violent sneeze.
"Goujaud was with me," said Tricotrin.
"Monsieur Pitou, the composer."
"I ab hodoured. I trust badabe is dot dervous of gerbs? There is nothing to fear," said Pitou.
"So was Pitou!" added Tricotrin.
"Monsieur Sanquereau, the sculptor; monsieur Lajeunie, the novelist," continued the host. But
before he could present the rest of the company, Brochat was respectfully intimating to the
widow that her position in the Weeping Alone apartment was now untenable. He was
immediately commanded to lay another cover.
"Madame and comrades," declaimed Tricotrin, unrolling a voluminous manuscript, as they took
their seats around the pot-au-feu, "I have composed for this piteous occasion a brief poem!"
"I must beseech your pardon," stammered Flamant, rising in deep confusion; "I have nine
apologies to tender. Gentlemen, this touching wreath for the tomb of my career finds the tomb
unready. These affecting garments which you have hired at, I fear, ruinous expense, should be
exchanged for bunting; that immortal poem with which our friend would favour us has been
suddenly deprived of all its point."
"Explain! explain!" volleyed from nine throats.

"I shall still read it," insisted Tricotrin, "it is good."
"The lady--nay, the goddess--whom you behold, has showered commissions, and for one year
more I shall still be in your midst. Brothers in art, brothers in heart, I ask you to charge your
glasses, and let your voices ring. The toast is, 'Madame Aurore and her gift of the New Year!'"
"Madame Aurore and her gift of the New Year!" shrieked the nine young men, springing to their
feet.
"In a year much may happen," said the lady tremulously.
And when they had all sat down again, Flamant was thrilled to find her hand in his beneath the
table.
THE DRESS CLOTHES OF MONSIEUR POMPONNET
It was thanks to Touquet that she was able to look so chic--the little baggage!--yet of all her
suitors Touquet was the one she favoured least. He was the costumier at the corner of the rue
des Martyrs, and made a very fair thing of the second-hand clothes. It was to Touquet's that the
tradesmen of the quarter turned as a matter of course to hire dress-suits for their nuptials; it was
in the well-cleaned satins of Touquet that the brides' mothers and the lady guests cut such
imposing figures when they were photographed after the wedding breakfasts; it was even
Touquet who sometimes supplied a gown to one or another of the humble actresses at the
Théâtre Montmartre, and received a couple of free tickets in addition to his fee. I tell you that
Touquet was not a person to be sneezed at, though he had passed the first flush of youth, and
was never an Adonis.
Besides, who was she, this little Lisette, who had the impudence to flout him? A girl in a florist's,
if you can believe me, with no particular beauty herself, and not a son by way of dot! And
yet--one must confess it--she turned a head as swiftly as she made a "buttonhole"; and
Pomponnet, the pastrycook, was paying court to her, too--to say nothing of the homage of
messieurs Tricotrin, the poet, and Goujaud, the painter, and Lajeunie, the novelist. You would
never have guessed that her wages were only twenty francs a week, as you watched her waltz
with Tricotrin at the ball on Saturday evening, or as you saw her enter Pomponnet's shop, when
the shutters were drawn, to feast on his strawberry tarts. Her costumes were the cynosure of
the boulevard Rochechouart!
And they were all due to Touquet, Touquet the infatuated, who lent the fine feathers to her for
the sake of a glance, or a pressure of the hand--and wept on his counter afterwards while he
wondered whose arms might be embracing her in the costumes that he had cleaned and
pressed with so much care. Often he swore that his folly should end--that she should be
affianced to him, or go shabby; but, lo! in a day or two she would make her appearance again,
to coax for the loan of a smart blouse, or "that hat with the giant rose and the ostrich
plume"--and Touquet would be as weak as ever.
Judge, then, of his despair when he heard that she had agreed to marry Pomponnet! She told
him the news with the air of an amiable gossip when she came to return a ball-dress that she
had borrowed.

"Enfin," she said--perched on the counter, and swinging her remorseless feet--"it is arranged; I
desert the flowers for the pastry, and become the mistress of a shop. I shall have to beg from
my good friend monsieur Touquet no more--not at all! I shall be his client, like the rest. It will be
better, hein?"
Touquet groaned. "You know well, Lisette," he answered, "that it has been a joy to me to place
the stock at your disposal, even though it was to make you more attractive in the eyes of other
men. Everything here that you have worn possesses a charm to me. I fondle the garments
when you bring them back; I take them down from the pegs and dream over them. Truly! There
is no limit to my weakness, for often when a client proposes to hire a frock that you have had, I
cannot bear that she should profane it, and I say that it is engaged."
"You dear, kind monsieur Touquet," murmured the coquette; "how agreeable you are!"
"I have always hoped for the day when the stock would be all your own, Lisette. And by-and-by
we might have removed to a better position-- even down the hill. Who knows? We might have
opened a business in the Madeleine quarter. That would suit you better than a little cake-shop
up a side street? And I would have risked it for you--I know how you incline to fashion. When I
have taken you to a theatre, did you choose the Montmartre--where we might have gone for
nothing--or the Moncey? Not you!--that might do for other girls. _You_ have always demanded
the theatres of the Grand Boulevard; a cup of coffee at the Café de la Paix is more to your taste
than a bottle of beer and hard-boiled eggs at The Nimble Rabbit. Heaven knows I trust you will
be happy, but I cannot persuade myself that this Pomponnet shares your ambitions; with his
slum and his stale pastry he is quite content."
"It is not stale," she said.
"Well, we will pass his pastry--though, word of honour, I bought some there last week that might
have been baked before the Commune; but to recur to his soul, is it an affinity?"
"Affinities are always hard up," she pouted.
"Zut!" exclaimed Touquet; "now your mind is running on that monsieur Tricotrin--by 'affinities' I
do not mean hungry poets. Why not have entrusted your happiness to _me_? I adore you, I
have told you a thousand times that I adore you. Lisette, consider before it is too late! You
cannot love this--this obscure baker?"
She gave a shrug. "It is a fact that devotion has not robbed me of my appetite," she confessed.
"But what would you have? His business goes far better than you imagine--I have seen his
books; and anyhow, my sentiment for you is friendship, and no more."
"To the devil with friendship!" cried the unhappy wardrobe-dealer; "did I dress you like the
Empress Joséphine for friendship?"
"Do not mock yourself of it," she said reprovingly; "remember that 'Friendship is a beautiful
flower, of which esteem is the stem.'" And, having thrown the adage to him, coupled with a
glance that drove him to distraction, the little flirt jumped off the counter and was gone.
Much more reluctantly she contemplated parting with him whom the costumier had described as

a "hungry poet"; but matrimony did not enter the poet's scheme of things, nor for that matter had
she ever regarded him as a possible parti. Yet a woman may give her fancy where her reason
refuses to follow, and when she imparted her news to Tricotrin there was no smile on her lips.
"We shall not go to balls any more, old dear," she said. "Monsieur Pomponnet has proposed
marriage to me--and I settle down."
"Heartless girl," exclaimed the young man, with tears in his eyes. "So much for woman's
constancy!"
"Mon Dieu," she faltered, "did you then love me, Gustave--really?"
"I do not know," said Tricotrin, "but since I am to lose you, I prefer to think so. Ah, do not grieve
for me--fortunately, there is always the Seine! And first I shall pour my misery into song; and in
years to come, fair daughters at your side will read the deathless poem, little dreaming that the
Lisette I sang to is their mother. Some time--long after I am in my grave, when France has
honoured me at last--you may stand before a statue that bears my name, and think, 'He loved
me, and I broke his heart!'"
"Oh," she whimpered, "rather than break your heart I--I might break the engagement! I might
consider again, Gustave."
"No, no," returned Tricotrin, "I will not reproach myself with the thought that I have marred your
life; I will leave you free. Besides, as I say, I am not certain that I should want you so much but
for the fact that I have lost you. After all, you will not appreciate the poem that immortalises you,
and if I lived, many of your remarks about it would doubtless infuriate me."
"Why shall I not appreciate it? Am I so stupid?"
"It is not that you are stupid, my Soul," he explained; "it is that I am transcendentally clever. To
understand the virtues of my work one must have sipped from all the flowers of Literature.
'There is to be found in it Racine, Voltaire, Flaubert, Renan--and always Gustave Tricotrin,' as
Lemaître has written. He wrote, '--and always Anatole France,' but I paraphrase him slightly. So
you are going to marry Pomponnet? Mon Dieu, when I have any sous in my pocket, I will ruin
myself, for the rapture of regretting you among the pastry!"
"I thought," she said, a little mortified, "that you were going to drown yourself?"
"Am I not to write my Lament to you? I must eat while I write it--why not pastry? Also, when I am
penniless and starving, you may sometimes, in your prosperity--And yet, perhaps, it is too much
to ask?"
"Give you tick, do you mean, dear? But yes, Gustave; how can you doubt that I will do that? In
memory of--"
"In memory of the love that has been, you will permit me to run up a small score for cakes, will
you not, Lisette?"
"I will, indeed!" she promised. "But, but--Oh, it's quite true, I should never understand you! A

minute ago you made me think of you in the Morgue, and now you make me think of you in the
cake-shop. What are you laughing at?"
"I laugh, like Figaro," said Tricotrin, "that I may not be obliged to weep. When are you going to
throw yourself away, my little Lisette? Has my accursed rival induced you to fix a date?'
"We are to be married in a fortnight's time," she said. "And if you could undertake to be sensible,
I would ask Alphonse to invite you to the breakfast."
"In a fortnight's time hunger and a hopeless passion will probably have made an end of me,"
replied the poet; "however, if I survive, the breakfast will certainly be welcome. Where is it to be
held? I can recommend a restaurant that is especially fine at such affairs, and most moderate.
'Photographs of the party are taken gratuitously in the Jardin d'Acclimatation, and pianos are at
the disposal of the ladies'; I quote from the menu--I study it in the window every time I pass.
There are wedding breakfasts from six to twelve francs per head. At six francs, the party have
their choice of two soups and three hors d'oeuvres. Then comes 'poisson'--I fear it may be
whiting--filet de boeuf with tomates farcies, bouchées à la Reine, chicken, pigeons, salad, two
vegetables, an ice, assorted fruits, and biscuits. The wines are madeira, a bottle of mâcon to
each person, a bottle of bordeaux among four persons, and a bottle of champagne among ten
persons. Also coffee and liqueurs. At six francs a head! It is good, hein? At seven francs there is
a bottle of champagne among every eight persons-- Pomponnet will, of course, do as he thinks
best. At eight francs, a bottle is provided for every six persons. I have too much delicacy to
make suggestions, but should he be willing to soar to twelve francs a head, I might eat enough
to last a week--and of such quality! The soups would then be bisque d'écrevisse and consommé
Rachel. Rissoles de foies gras would appear. Asparagus 'in branches,' and compote of peaches
flavoured with maraschino would be included. Also, in the twelve-franc breakfast, the
champagne begins to have a human name on the label!"
Now, it is not certain how much of this information Lisette repeated to Pomponnet, but
Pomponnet, having a will of his own, refused to entertain monsieur Tricotrin at any price at all.
More-over, he found it unconventional that she should desire the poet's company, considering
the attentions that he had paid her; and she was forced to listen, with an air of humility which
she was far from feeling, to a lecture on the responsibilities of her new position.
"I am not a jealous man," said the pastrycook, who was as jealous a man as ever baked a pie;
"but it would be discreet that you dropped this acquaintance now that we are engaged. I know
well that you have never taken the addresses of such a fellow seriously, and that it is only in the
goodness of your heart you wish to present him with a blow-out. Nevertheless, the betrothal of a
man in my circumstances is much remarked; all the daughters of the hairdresser next door have
had their hopes of me--indeed, there is scarcely a neighbour who is not chagrined at the turn
events have taken--and the world would be only too glad of an excuse to call me 'fool.'
Pomponnet's wife must be above suspicion. You will remember that a little lightness of conduct
which might be forgiven in the employée of the florist would be unseemly in my fiancée. No
more conversation with monsieur Tricotrin, Lisette! Some dignity--some coldness in the bow
when you pass him. The boulevard will observe it, it will be approved."
"You, of course, know best, my dear Alphonse," she returned meekly; "I am only an
inexperienced girl, and I am thankful to have your advice to guide me. But let me say that never,
never has there been any 'lightness of conduct,' to distress you. Monsieur Tricotrin and I have
 49 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
been merely friends. If I have gone to a ball with him sometimes--and I acknowledge that has
happened--it has been because nobody more to my taste has offered to take me." She had
ground her little teeth under the infliction of his homily, and it was only by dint of thinking hard of
his profits that she abstained from retorting that he might marry all the daughters of the
hairdresser and go to Uganda.
However, during the next week or so, she did not chance to meet the poet on the boulevard;
and since she wished to conquer her tenderness for him, one cannot doubt that all would have
been well but for the Editor of _L'Echo de la Butte._ By a freak of fate, the Editor of _L'Echo de
la Butte_ was moved to invite monsieur Tricotrin to an affair of ceremony two days previous to
the wedding. What followed? Naturally Tricotrin must present himself in evening dress.
Naturally, also, he must go to Touquet's to hire the suit.
"Regard," said the costumier, "here is a suit that I have just acquired. Monsieur will observe that
it is of the most distinguished cut--quite in the latest fashion. I will whisper to monsieur that it
comes to me through the valet of the Comte de St.-Nom-la-Bretèche- Forêt-de-Marly."
"Mon Dieu!" said Tricotrin, "let me try it on!" And he was so gratified by his appearance in it that
he barely winced at the thought of the expense. "I am improving my position," he soliloquised; "if
I have not precisely inherited the mantle of Victor Hugo, I have, at any rate, hired the dress-suit
of the Comte de St.-Nom-la-Bretèche-Forêt-de- Marly!"
Never had a more impressive spectacle been witnessed in Montmartre than Tricotrin's
departure from his latest lodging shortly after six o'clock. Wearing a shirt of Pitou's, Flamant's
patent-leather boots, and a white tie contributed by Goujaud, the young man sallied forth with
the deportment of the Count himself. Only one thing more did he desire, a flower for his
buttonhole--and Lisette remained in her situation until the morrow! What more natural, finally,
than that he should hie him to the florist's?
It was the first time that she had seen her lover in evening dress, and sentiment overpowered
her as he entered.
"Thou!" she murmured, paling.
On the poet, too, the influence of the clothes was very strong; attired like a jeune premier, he
craved with all the dramatic instinct of his nature for a love scene; and, instead of fulfilling his
intention to beg for a rosebud at cost price, he gazed at her soulfully and breathed "Lisette!"
"So we have met again!" she said.
"The world is small," returned the poet, ignoring the fact that he had come to the shop. "And am
I yet remembered?"
"It is not likely I should forget you in a few days," she said, more practically; "I didn't forget about
the breakfast, either, but Alphonse put his foot down."
"Pig!" said the poet. "And yet it may be better so! How could I eat in such an hour?"
"However, you are not disconsolate this evening?" she suggested. "Mais vrai! what a swell you
 50 / 166

are!"
"Flûte! some fashionable assembly that will bore me beyond endurance," he sighed. "With you
alone, Lisette, have I known true happiness--the train rides on summer nights that were joyous
because we loved; the simple meals that were sweetened by your smile!"
"Ah, Gustave!" she said. "Wait, I must give you a flower for your coat!"
"I shall keep it all my life!" vowed Tricotrin. "Tell me, little one--I dare not stay now, because my
host lives a long way off--but this evening, could you not meet me once again? For the last time,
to say farewell? I have nearly two francs fifty, and we might go to supper, if you agree."
It was arranged before he took leave of her that she should meet him outside the _débit_ at the
corner of the rue de Sontay at eleven o'clock, and sup with him there, in a locality where she
was unlikely to be recognised. Rash enough, this conduct, for a young woman who was to be
married to another man on the next day but one! But a greater imprudence was to follow. They
supped, they sentimentalised, and when they parted in the Champs Elysées and the
moonshine, she gave him from her bosom a little rose-coloured envelope that contained nothing
less than a lock of her hair.
The poet placed it tenderly in his waistcoat pocket; and, after he had wept, and quoted poetry to
the stars, forgot it. He began to wish that he had not mixed his liquors quite so impartially; and,
on the morrow, when he woke, he was mindful of nothing more grievous than a splitting
headache.
Now Touquet, who could not sleep of nights because the pastrycook was going to marry Lisette,
made a practice of examining the pockets of all garments returned to him, with an eye to stray
sous; and when he proceeded to examine the pockets of the dress-suit returned by monsieur
Tricotrin, what befell but that he drew forth a rose-tinted envelope containing a tress of hair, and
inscribed, "To Gustave, from Lisette. Adieu."
And the Editor who invited monsieur Tricotrin had never heard of Lisette; never heard of
Pomponnet; did not know that such a person as Touquet existed; yet the editorial caprice had
manipulated destinies. How powerful are Editors! How complicated is life!
But a truce to philosophy--let us deal with the emotions of the soul! The shop reeled before
Touquet. All the good and the bad in his character battled tumultuously. In one moment he
aspired to be generous and restore to Lisette the evidence of her guilt; in the next he sank to
the base thought of displaying it to Pomponnet and breaking off the match. The discovery fired
his brain. No longer was he a nonentity, the odd man out--chance had transformed him to the
master of the situation. Full well he knew that there would be no nuptials next day were
Pomponnet aware of his fiancée's perfidy; it needed but to go to him and say, "Monsieur, my
sense of duty compels me to inform you--." How easy it would be! He laughed hysterically.
But Lisette would never pardon such a meanness--she would always despise and hate him! He
would have torn her from his rival's arms, it was true, yet his own would still be empty. "Ah,
Lisette, Lisette!" groaned the wretched man; and, swept to evil by the force of passion, he
cudgelled his mind to devise some piece of trickery, some diabolical artifice, by which the
incriminating token might be placed in the pastrycook's hands as if by accident.

And while he pondered--his "whole soul a chaos"--in that hour Pomponnet entered to hire a
dress-suit for his wedding!
Touquet raised his head, blanched to the lips.
"Regard," he said, with a forced calm terrible to behold; "here is a suit that I have just acquired.
Monsieur will observe that it is of the most distinguished cut--quite in the latest fashion. I will
whisper to monsieur that it comes to me through the valet of the Comte de St. Nom- la-BretécheForét-de-Marly." And, unseen by the guileless bridegroom, he slipped the damning proof into a
pocket of the trousers, where his knowledge of the pastrycook's attitudes assured him that it
was even more certain to be found than in the waistcoat.
"Mon Dieu!" said the other, duly impressed by the suit's pedigree; "let me try it on.... The coat is
rather tight," he complained, "but it has undeniably an air."
"No more than one client has worn it," gasped the wardrobe dealer haggardly: _"monsieur
Gustave Tricotrin, the poet, who hired it last night!_ The suit is practically new; I have no other in
the establishment to compare with it. Listen, monsieur Pomponnet! To an old client like yourself,
I will be liberal; wear it this evening for an hour in your home--if you find it not to your figure,
there will be time to make another selection before the ceremony to-morrow. You shall have this
on trial, I will make no extra charge."
Such munificence was bound to have its effect, and five minutes later Touquet's plot had
progressed. But the tension had been frightful; the door had scarcely closed when he sank into
a chair, trembling in every limb, and for the rest of the day he attended to his business like one
moving in a trance.
Meanwhile, the unsuspecting Pomponnet reviewed the arrangement with considerable
satisfaction; and when he came to attire himself, after the cake-shop was shut, his reflected
image pleased him so well that he was tempted to stroll abroad. He decided to call on his
betrothed, and to exhibit himself a little on the boulevard. Accordingly, he put some money in
the pocket of the waistcoat, oiled his silk hat, to give it an additional lustre, and sallied forth in
high good-humour.
"How splendid you look, my dear Alphonse!" exclaimed Lisette, little dreaming it was the same
suit that she had approved on Tricotrin the previous evening.
Her innocent admiration was agreeable to Pomponnet; he patted her on the cheek.
"In truth," he said carelessly, "I had forgotten that I had it on! But I was so impatient for tomorrow, my pet angel, that I could not remain alone and I had to come to see you."
They were talking on her doorstep, for she had no apartment in which it would have been
_convenable_ to entertain him, and it appeared to him that the terrace of a café would be more
congenial.
"Run upstairs and make your toilette, my loving duck," he suggested, "and I shall take you out
for a tasse. While you are getting ready, I will smoke a cigar." And he drew his cigar-case from
the breast-pocket of the coat, and took a match-box from the pocket where he had put his cash.

It was a balmy evening, sweet with the odour of spring, and the streets were full of life. As he
promenaded with her on the boulevard, Pomponnet did not fail to remark the attention
commanded by his costume. He strutted proudly, and when they reached the café and took
their seats, he gave his order with the authority of the President.
"Ah!" he remarked, "it is good here, hein?" And then, stretching his legs, he thrust both his
hands into the pockets of his trousers. "_Comment?_" he murmured. "What have I found?...
Now is not this amusing--I swear it is a billet-doux!" He bent, chuckling, to the light--and
bounded in his chair with an oath that turned a dozen heads towards them. "Traitress," roared
Pomponnet, "miserable traitress! It is _your_ name! It is your _writing_! It is your _hair_! Do not
deny it; give me your head--it matches to a shade! Jezebel, last night you met monsieur
Tricotrin--you have deceived me!"
Lisette, who had jumped as high as he in recognising the envelope, sat like one paralysed now.
Her tongue refused to move. For an instant, the catastrophe seemed to her of supernatural
agency--it was as if a miracle had happened, as she saw her fiancé produce her lover's
keepsake. All she could stammer at last was:
"Let us go away--pay for the coffee!"
"I will not pay," shouted monsieur Pomponnet. "Pay for it yourself, jade--I have done with you!"
And, leaving her spellbound at the table, he strode from the terrace like a madman before the
waiters could stop him.
Oh, of course, he was well known at the café, and they did not detain Lisette, but it was a most
ignominious position for a young woman. And there was no wedding next day, and everybody
knew why. The little coquette, who had mocked suitors by the dozen, was jilted almost on the
threshold of the Mairie. She smacked Tricotrin's face in the morning, but her humiliation was so
acute that it demanded the salve of immediate marriage; and at the moment she could think of
no one better than Touquet.
So Touquet won her after all. And though by this time she may guess how he accomplished it,
he will tell you--word of honour!--that never, never has he had occasion for regret.
THE SUICIDES IN THE RUE SOMBRE
Having bought the rope, Tournicquot wondered where he should hang himself. The lath-andplaster ceiling of his room might decline to support him, and while the streets were populous a
lamp-post was out of the question. As he hesitated on the kerb, he reflected that a pan of
charcoal would have been more convenient after all; but the coil of rope in the doorway of a
shop had lured his fancy, and now it would be laughable to throw it away.
Tournicquot was much averse from being laughed at in private life-- perhaps because Fate had
willed that he should be laughed at so much in his public capacity. Could he have had his way,
indeed, Tournicquot would have been a great tragedian, instead of a little droll, whose portraits,
with a bright red nose and a scarlet wig, grimaced on the hoardings; and he resolved that, at
any rate, the element of humour should not mar his suicide.
As to the motive for his death, it was as romantic as his heart desired. He adored "La Belle

Lucèrce," the fascinating Snake Charmer, and somewhere in the background the artiste had a
husband. Little the audience suspected the passion that devoured their grotesque comedian
while he cut his capers and turned love to ridicule; little they divined the pathos of a situation
which condemned him behind the scenes to whisper the most sentimental assurances of
devotion when disfigured by a flaming wig and a nose that was daubed vermilion! How nearly it
has been said, One half of the world does not know how the other half loves!
But such incongruities would distress Tournicquot no more--to-day he was to die; he had worn
his chessboard trousers and his little green coat for the last time! For the last time had the
relentless virtue of Lucrèce driven him to despair! When he was discovered inanimate, hanging
to a beam, nothing comic about him, perhaps the world would admit that his soul had been
solemn, though his "line of business" had been funny; perhaps Lucrèce would even drop warm
tears on his tomb!
It was early in the evening. Dusk was gathering over Paris, the promise of dinner was in the
breeze. The white glare of electric globes began to flood the streets; and before the cafés,
waiters bustled among the tables, bearing the vermouth and absinthe of the hour. Instinctively
shunning the more frequented thoroughfares, Tournicquot crossed the boulevard des
Batignolles, and wandered, lost in reverie, along the melancholy continuation of the rue de
Rome until he perceived that he had reached a neighbourhood unknown to him--that he stood
at the corner of a street which bore the name "Rue Sombre." Opposite, one of the houses was
being rebuilt, and as he gazed at it--this skeleton of a home in which the workmen's hammers
were silenced for the night-- Tournicquot recognised that his journey was at an end. Here, he
could not doubt that he would find the last, grim hospitality that he sought. The house had no
door to bar his entrance, but--as if in omen--above the gap where a door had been, the sinister
number "13" was still to be discerned. He cast a glance over his shoulder, and, grasping the
rope with a firm hand, crept inside.
It was dark within, so dark that at first he could discern nothing but the gleam of bare walls. He
stole along the passage, and, mounting a flight of steps, on which his feet sprung mournful
echoes, proceeded stealthily towards an apartment on the first floor. At this point the darkness
became impenetrable, for the _volets_ had been closed, and in order to make his
arrangements, it was necessary that he should have a light. He paused, fumbling in his pocket;
and then, with his next step, blundered against a body, which swung from the contact, like a
human being suspended in mid-air.
Tournicquot leapt backwards in terror. A cold sweat bespangled him, and for some seconds he
shook so violently that he was unable to strike a match. At last, when he accomplished it, he
beheld a man, apparently dead, hanging by a rope in the doorway.
"Ah, mon Dieu!" gasped Tournicquot. And the thudding of his heart seemed to resound through
the deserted house.
Humanity impelled him to rescue the poor wretch, if it was still to be done. Shuddering, he
whipped out his knife, and sawed at the cord desperately. The cord was stout, and the blade of
the knife but small; an eternity seemed to pass while he sawed in the darkness. Presently one
of the strands gave way. He set his teeth and pressed harder, and harder yet. Suddenly the
rope yielded and the body fell to the ground. Tournicquot threw himself beside it, tearing open
the collar, and using frantic efforts to restore animation. There was no result. He persevered, but
 54 / 166

the body lay perfectly inert. He began to reflect that it was his duty to inform the police of the
discovery, and he asked himself how he should account for his presence on the scene. Just as
he was considering this, he felt the stir of life. As if by a miracle the man groaned.
"Courage, my poor fellow!" panted Tournicquot. "Courage--all is well!"
The man groaned again; and after an appalling silence, during which Tournicquot began to
tremble for his fate anew, asked feebly, "Where am I?"
"You would have hanged yourself," explained Tournicquot. "Thanks to Heaven, I arrived in time
to save your life!"
In the darkness they could not see each other, but he felt for the man's hand and pressed it
warmly. To his consternation, he received, for response, a thump in the chest.
"Morbleu, what an infernal cheek!" croaked the man. "So you have cut me down? You
meddlesome idiot, by what right did you poke your nose into my affairs, hein?"
Dismay held Tournicquot dumb.
"Hein?" wheezed the man; "what concern was it of yours, if you please? Never in my life before
have I met with such a piece of presumption!"
"My poor friend," stammered Tournicquot, "you do not know what you say --you are not
yourself! By-and-by you will be grateful, you will fall on your knees and bless me."
"By-and-by I shall punch you in the eye," returned the man, "just as soon as I am feeling better!
What have you done to my collar, too? I declare you have played the devil with me!" His
annoyance rose. "Who are you, and what are you doing here, anyhow? You are a trespasser--I
shall give you in charge."
"Come, come," said Tournicquot, conciliatingly, "if your misfortunes are more than you can bear,
I regret that I was obliged to save you; but, after all, there is no need to make such a grievance
of it--you can hang yourself another day."
"And why should I be put to the trouble twice?" grumbled the other. "Do you figure yourself that
it is agreeable to hang? I passed a very bad time, I can assure you. If you had experienced it,
you would not talk so lightly about 'another day.' The more I think of your impudent interference,
the more it vexes me. And how dark it is! Get up and light the candle--it gives me the hump
here."
"I have no candle, I have no candle," babbled Tournicquot; "I do not carry candles in my
pocket."
"There is a bit on the mantelpiece," replied the man angrily; "I saw it when I came in. Go and
feel for it--hunt about! Do not keep me lying here in the dark--the least you can do is to make
me as comfortable as you can."
Tournicquot, not a little perturbed by the threat of assault, groped obediently; but the room
 55 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
appeared to be of the dimensions of a park, and he arrived at the candle stump only after a
prolonged excursion. The flame revealed to him a man of about his own age, who leant against
the wall regarding him with indignant eyes. Revealed also was the coil of rope that the
comedian had brought for his own use; and the man pointed to it.
"What is that? It was not here just now."
"It belongs to me," admitted Tournicquot, nervously.
"I see that it belongs to you. Why do you visit an empty house with a coil of rope, hein? I should
like to understand that ... Upon my life, you were here on the same business as myself! Now if
this does not pass all forbearance! You come to commit suicide, and yet you have the effrontery
to put a stop to mine!"
"Well," exclaimed Tournicquot, "I obeyed an impulse of pity! It is true that I came to destroy
myself, for I am the most miserable of men; but I was so much affected by the sight of your
sufferings that temporarily I forgot my own."
"That is a lie, for I was not suffering--I was not conscious when you came in. However, you have
some pretty moments in front of you, so we will say no more! When you feel yourself drop, it will
be diabolical, I promise you; the hair stands erect on the head, and each spot of blood in the
veins congeals to a separate icicle! It is true that the drop itself is swift, but the clutch of the
rope, as you kick in the air, is hardly less atrocious. Do not be encouraged by the delusion that
the matter is instantaneous. Time mocks you, and a second holds the sensations of a quarter of
an hour. What has forced you to it? We need not stand on ceremony with each other, hein?"
"I have resolved to die because life is torture," said Tournicquot, on whom these details had
made an unfavourable impression.
"The same with me! A woman, of course?"
"Yes," sighed Tournicquot, "a woman!"
"Is there no other remedy? Cannot you desert her?"
"Desert her? I pine for her embrace!"
"Hein?"
"She will not have anything to do with me."
"_Comment?_ Then it is love with you?"
"What else? An eternal passion!"
"Oh, mon Dieu, I took it for granted you were married! But this is droll. _You_ would die because
you cannot get hold of a woman, and _I_ because I cannot get rid of one. We should talk, we
two. Can you give me a cigarette?"

"With pleasure, monsieur," responded Tournicquot, producing a packet. "I, also, will take
one--my last!"
"If I expressed myself hastily just now," said his companion, refastening his collar, "I shall
apologise--no doubt your interference was well meant, though I do not pretend to approve it. Let
us dismiss the incident; you have behaved tactlessly, and I, on my side, have perhaps resented
your error with too much warmth. Well, it is finished! While the candle burns, let us exchange
more amicable views. Is my cravat straight? It astonishes me to hear that love can drive a man
to such despair. I, too, have loved, but never to the length of the rope. There are plenty of
women in Paris--if one has no heart, there is always another. I am far from proposing to
frustrate your project, holding as I do that a man's suicide is an intimate matter in which 'rescue'
is a name given by busybodies to a gross impertinence; but as you have not begun the job, I will
confess that I think you are being rash."
"I have considered," replied Tournicquot, "I have considered attentively. There is no alternative,
I assure you."
"I would make another attempt to persuade the lady--I swear I would make another attempt!
You are not a bad-looking fellow. What is her objection to you?"
"It is not that she objects to me--on the contrary. But she is a woman of high principle, and she
has a husband who is devoted to her--she will not break his heart. It is like that."
"Young?"
"No more than thirty."
"And beautiful?"
"With a beauty like an angel's! She has a dimple in her right cheek when she smiles that drives
one to distraction."
"Myself, I have no weakness for dimples; but every man to his taste-- there is no arguing about
these things. What a combination--young, lovely, virtuous! And I make you a bet the oaf of a
husband does not appreciate her! Is it not always so? Now _I_--but of course I married foolishly,
I married an artiste. If I had my time again I would choose in preference any sempstress. The
artistes are for applause, for bouquets, for little dinners, but not for marriage."
"I cannot agree with you," said Tournicquot, with some hauteur, "Your experience may have
been unfortunate, but the theatre contains women quite as noble as any other sphere. In proof
of it, the lady I adore is an artiste herself!"
"Really--is it so? Would it be indiscreet to ask her name?"
"There are things that one does not tell."
"But as a matter of interest? There is nothing derogatory to her in what you say--quite the
reverse."

"True! Well, the reason for reticence is removed. She is known as 'La Belle Lucrèce.'"
"_Hein?"_ ejaculated the other, jumping.
"What ails you?"
"She is my wife!"
"Your wife? Impossible!"
"I tell you I am married to her--she is 'madame Béguinet.'"
"Mon Dieu!" faltered Tournicquot, aghast; "what have I done!"
"So?... You are her lover?"
"Never has she encouraged me--recall what I said! There are no grounds for jealousy--am I not
about to die because she spurns me? I swear to you--"
"You mistake my emotion--why should I be jealous? Not at all--I am only amazed. She thinks I
am devoted to her? Ho, ho! Not at all! You see my 'devotion' by the fact that I am about to hang
myself rather than live with her. And _you_, you cannot bear to live because you adore her!
Actually, you adore her! Is it not inexplicable? Oh, there is certainly the finger of Providence in
this meeting!... Wait, we must discuss--we should come to each other's aid!... Give me another
cigarette."
Some seconds passed while they smoked in silent meditation.
"Listen," resumed monsieur Béguinet; "in order to clear up this complication, a perfect candour
is required on both sides. Alors, as to your views, is it that you aspire to marry madame? I do
not wish to appear exigent, but in the position that I occupy you will realise that it is my duty to
make the most favourable arrangements for her that I can. Now open your heart to me; speak
frankly!"
"It is difficult for me to express myself without restraint to you, monsieur," said Tournicquot,
"because circumstances cause me to regard you as a grievance. To answer you with all the
delicacy possible, I will say that if I had cut you down five minutes later, life would be a fairer
thing to me."
"Good," said monsieur Béguinet, "we make progress! Your income? Does it suffice to support
her in the style to which she is accustomed? What may your occupation be?"
"I am in madame's own profession--I, too, am an artiste."
"So much the more congenial! I foresee a joyous union. Come, we go famously! Your line of
business--snakes, ventriloquism, performing- rabbits, what is it?"
"My name is 'Tournicquot,'" responded the comedian, with dignity. "All is said!"

"A-ah! Is it so? Now I understand why your voice has been puzzling me! Monsieur Tournicquot,
I am enchanted to make your acquaintance. I declare the matter arranges itself! I shall tell you
what we will do. Hitherto I have had no choice between residing with madame and committing
suicide, because my affairs have not prospered, and--though my pride has revolted--her salary
has been essential for my maintenance. Now the happy medium jumps to the eyes; for you, for
me, for her the bright sunshine streams! I shall efface myself; I shall go to a distant spot--say,
Monte Carlo--and you shall make me a snug allowance. Have no misgiving; crown her with
blossoms, lead her to the altar, and rest tranquil--I shall never reappear. Do not figure yourself
that I shall enter like the villain at the Amibigu and menace the blissful home. Not at all! I myself
may even re-marry, who knows? Indeed, should you offer me an allowance adequate for a
family man, I will undertake to re-marry--I have always inclined towards speculation. That will
shut my mouth, hein? I could threaten nothing, even if I had a base nature, for I, also, shall have
committed bigamy. Suicide, bigamy, I would commit _anything_ rather than live with Lucrèce!"
"But madame's consent must be gained," demurred Tournicquot; "you overlook the fact that
madame must consent. It is a fact that I do not understand why she should have any
consideration for you, but if she continues to harp upon her 'duty,' what then?"
"Do you not tell me that her only objection to your suit has been her fear that she would break
my heart? What an hallucination! I shall approach the subject with tact, with the utmost delicacy.
I shall intimate to her that to ensure her happiness I am willing to sacrifice myself. Should she
hesitate, I shall demand to sacrifice myself! Rest assured that if she regards you with the favour
that you believe, your troubles are at an end--the barrier removes itself, and you join hands....
The candle is going out! Shall we depart?"
"I perceive no reason why we should remain; In truth, we might have got out of it sooner."
"You are right! a café will be more cheerful. Suppose we take a bottle of wine together; how
does it strike you? If you insist, I will be your guest; if not--"
"Ah, monsieur, you will allow me the pleasure," murmured Tournicquot.
"Well, well," said Beguinet, "you must have your way!... Your rope you have no use for, hein--we
shall leave it?"
"But certainly! Why should I burden myself?"
"The occasion has passed, true. Good! Come, my comrade, let us descend!"
Who shall read the future? Awhile ago they had been strangers, neither intending to quit the
house alive; now the pair issued from it jauntily, arm in arm. Both were in high spirits, and by the
time the lamps of a café gave them welcome, and the wine gurgled gaily into the glasses, they
pledged each other with a sentiment no less than fraternal.
"How I rejoice that I have met you!" exclaimed Béguinet. "To your marriage, mon vieux; to your
joy! Fill up, again a glass!--there are plenty of bottles in the cellar. Mon Dieu, you are my
preserver--I must embrace you. Never till now have I felt such affection for a man. This evening
all was black to me; I despaired, my heart was as heavy as a cannon-ball--and suddenly the
world is bright. Roses bloom before my feet, and the little larks are singing in the sky. I dance, I

skip. How beautiful, how sublime is friendship!--better than riches, than youth, than the love of
woman: riches melt, youth flies, woman snores. But friendship is--Again a glass! It goes well,
this wine.
"Let us have a lobster! I swear I have an appetite; they make one peckish, these suicides, n'estce pas? I shall not be formal--if you consider it your treat, you shall pay. A lobster and another
bottle! At your expense, or mine?"
"Ah, the bill all in one!" declared Tourniequot.
"Well, well," said Béguinet, "you must have your way! What a happy man I am! Already I feel
twenty years younger. You would not believe what I have suffered. My agonies would fill a book.
Really. By nature I am domesticated; but my home is impossible--I shudder when I enter it. It is
only in a restaurant that I see a clean table-cloth. Absolutely. I pig. All Lucrèce thinks about is
frivolity."
"No, no," protested Tournicquot; "to that I cannot agree."
"What do you know? You 'cannot agree'! You have seen her when she is laced in her stage
costume, when she prinks and prattles, with the paint, and the powder, and her best corset on.
It is I who am 'behind the scenes,' mon ami, not you. I see her dirty peignoir and her curl rags.
At four o'clock in the afternoon. Every day. You 'cannot agree'!"
"Curl rags?" faltered Tournicquot.
"But certainly! I tell you I am of a gentle disposition, I am most tolerant of women's failings; it
says much that I would have hanged myself rather than remain with a woman. Her untidiness is
not all; her toilette at home revolts my sensibilities, but--well, one cannot have everything, and
her salary is substantial; I have closed my eyes to the curl rags. However, snakes are more
serious."
"Snakes?" ejaculated Tournicquot.
"Naturally! The beasts must live, do they not support us? But 'Everything in its place' is my own
motto; the motto of my wife--'All over the place.' Her serpents have shortened my life, word of
honour!-- they wander where they will. I never lay my head beside those curl rags of hers
without anticipating a cobra-decapello under the bolster. It is not everybody's money. Lucrèce
has no objection to them; well, it is very courageous--very fortunate, since snakes are her
profession--but _I_, I was not brought up to snakes; I am not at my ease in a Zoölogical
Gardens."
"It is natural."
"Is it not? I desire to explain myself to you, you understand; are we not as brothers? Oh, I
realise well that when one loves a woman one always thinks that the faults are the husband's:
believe me I have had much to justify my attitude. Snakes, dirt, furies, what a ménage!"
"Furies?" gasped Tournicquot.

"I am an honest man," affirmed Béguinet draining another bumper; "I shall not say to you 'I have
no blemish, I am perfect,' Not at all. Without doubt, I have occasionally expressed myself to
Lucrèce with more candour than courtesy. Such things happen. But"--he refilled his glass, and
sighed pathetically--"but to every citizen, whatever his position--whether his affairs may have
prospered or not--his wife owes respect. Hein? She should not throw the ragoút at him. She
should not menace him with snakes." He wept. "My friend, you will admit that it is not _gentil_ to
coerce a husband with deadly reptiles?"
Tournicquot had turned very pale. He signed to the waiter for the bill, and when it was
discharged, sat regarding his companion with round eyes, At last, clearing his throat, he said
nervously:
"After all, do you know--now one comes to think it over--I am not sure, upon my honour, that our
arrangement is feasible?"
"What?" exclaimed Béguinet, with a violent start. "Not feasible? How is that, pray? Because I
have opened my heart to you, do you back out? Oh, what treachery! Never will I believe you
could be capable of it!"
"However, it is a fact. On consideration, I shall not rob you of her."
"Base fellow! You take advantage of my confidence. A contract is a contract!"
"No," stammered Tournicquot, "I shall be a man and live my love down. Monsieur, I have the
honour to wish you 'Good-night.'"
"Hé, stop!" cried Béguinet, infuriated. "What then is to become of _me_? Insolent poltroon--you
have even destroyed my rope!"
THE CONSPIRACY FOR CLAUDINE
"Once," remarked Tricotrin, pitching his pen in the air, "there were four suitors for the Most
Beautiful of her Sex. The first young man was a musician, and he shut himself in his garret to
compose a divine melody, to be dedicated to her. The second lover was a chemist, who
experimented day and night to discover a unique perfume that she alone might use. The third,
who was a floriculturist, aspired constantly among his bulbs to create a silver rose, that should
immortalise the lady's name."
"And the fourth," inquired Pitou, "what did the fourth suitor do?"
"The fourth suitor waited for her every afternoon in the sunshine, while the others were at work,
and married her with great éclat. The moral of which is that, instead of cracking my head to
make a sonnet to Claudine, I shall be wise to put on my hat and go to meet her."
"I rejoice that the dénoûment is arrived at," Pitou returned, "but it would be even more absorbing
if I had previously heard of Claudine."
"Miserable dullard!" cried the poet; "do you tell me that you have not previously heard of
Claudine? She is the only woman I have ever loved."

"A--ah," rejoined Pitou; "certainly, I have heard of her a thousand times--only she has never
been called 'Claudine' before."
"Let us keep to the point," said Tricotrin. "Claudine represents the devotion of a lifetime. I think
seriously of writing a tragedy for her to appear in."
"I shall undertake to weep copiously at it if you present me with a pass," affirmed Pitou. "She is
an actress, then, this Claudine? At what theatre is she blazing--the Montmartre?"
"How often I find occasion to lament that your imagination is no larger than the quartier!
Claudine is not of Montmartre at all, at all. My poor friend, have you never heard that there are
theatres on the Grand Boulevard?"
"Ah, so you betake yourself to haunts of fashion? Now I begin to understand why you have
become so prodigal with the blacking; for some time I have had the intention of reproaching you
with your shoes--our finances are not equal to such lustre."
"Ah, when one truly loves, money is no object!" said Tricotrin. "However, if it is time misspent to
write a sonnet to her, it is even more unprofitable to pass the evening justifying one's shoes."
And, picking up his hat, the poet ran down the stairs, and made his way as fast as his legs
would carry him to the Comédie Moderne.
He arrived at the stage-door with no more than three minutes to spare, and disposing himself in
a graceful attitude, waited for mademoiselle Claudine Hilairet to come out. It might have been
observed that his confidence deserted him while he waited, for although it was perfectly true
that he adored her, he had omitted to add that the passion was not mutual. He was conscious
that the lady might resent his presence on the door-step; and, in fact, when she appeared, she
said nothing more tender than--
"Mon Dieu, again you! What do you want?"
"How can you ask?" sighed the poet. "I came to walk home with you lest an electric train should
knock you down at one of the crossings. What a magnificent performance you have given this
evening! Superb!"
"Were you in the theatre?"
"In spirit. My spirit, which no official can exclude, is present every night, though sordid
considerations force me to remain corporally in my attic. Transported by admiration, I even burst
into frantic applause there. How perfect is the sympathy between our souls!"
"Listen, my little one," she said. "I am sorry for your relatives, if you have any--your condition
must be a great grief to them. But, all the same, I cannot have you dangling after me and talking
this bosh. What do you suppose can come of it?"
"Fame shall come of it," averred the poet, "fame for us both! Do not figure yourself that I am a
dreamer. Not at all! I am practical, a man of affairs. Are you content with your position in the
Comédie Moderne? No, you are not. You occupy a subordinate position; you play the rôle of a
waiting-maid, which is quite unworthy of your genius, and understudy the ingénue, who is a

portly matron in robust health. The opportunity to distinguish yourself appears to you as remote
as Mars. Do I romance, or is it true?"
"It is true," she said. "Well?"
"Well, I propose to alter all this--I! I have the intention of writing a great tragedy, and when it is
accepted, I shall stipulate that you, and you alone, shall thrill Paris as my heroine. When the
work of my brain has raised you to the pinnacle for which you were born, when the theatre
echoes with our names, I shall fall at your feet, and you will murmur, 'Gustave--I love thee!'"
"Why does not your mother do something?" she asked. "Is there nobody to place you where you
might be cured? A tragedy? Imbecile, I am comédienne to the finger-tips! What should I do with
your tragedy, even if it were at the Français itself?"
"You are right," said Tricotrin; "I shall turn out a brilliant comedy instead. And when the work of
my brain has raised you to the pinnacle for which you were born, when the theatre echoes with
our names--"
She interrupted him by a peal of laughter which disconcerted him hardly less than her
annoyance.
"It is impossible to be angry with you long," she declared, "you are too comic. Also, as a friend, I
do not object to you violently. Come, I advise you to be content with what you can have, instead
of crying for the moon!"
"Well, I am not unwilling to make shift with it in the meantime," returned Tricotrin; "but friendship
is a poor substitute for the heavens--and we shall see what we shall see. Tell me now, they
mean to revive _La Curieuse_ at the Comédie, I hear--what part in it have you been assigned?"
"Ah," exclaimed mademoiselle Hilairet, "is it not always the same thing? I dust the same
decayed furniture with the same feather brush, and I say 'Yes,' and 'No,' and 'Here is a letter,
madame.' That is all."
"I swear it is infamous!" cried the poet. "It amazes me that they fail to perceive that your gifts are
buried. One would suppose that managers would know better than to condemn a great artiste to
perform such ignominious roles. The critics also! Why do not the critics call attention to an
outrage which continues year by year? It appears to me that I shall have to use my influence
with the Press." And so serious was the tone in which he made this boast, that the fair Claudine
began to wonder if she had after all underrated the position of her out-at- elbows gallant.
"Your influence?" she questioned, with an eager smile. "Have you influence with the critics,
then?"
"We shall see what we shall see," repeated Tricotrin, significantly. "I am not unknown in Paris,
and I have your cause at heart--I may make a star of you yet. But while we are on the subject of
astronomy, one question! When my services have transformed you to a star, shall I still be
compelled to cry for the moon?"
Mademoiselle Hilairet's tones quivered with emotion--as she murmured how grateful to him she
would be, and it was understood, when he took leave of her, that if he indeed accomplished his
 63 / 166

design, his suit would be no longer hopeless.
The poet pressed her hand ardently, and turned homeward in high feather; and it was not until
he had trudged a mile or so that the rapture in his soul began to subside under the
remembrance that he had been talking through his hat.
"In fact," he admitted to Pitou when the garret was reached, "my imagination took wings unto
itself; I am committed to a task beside which the labours of Hercules were child's play. The
question now arises how this thing, of which I spoke so confidently, is to be effected. What do
you suggest?"
"I suggest that you allow me to sleep," replied Pitou, "for I shall feel less hungry then."
"Your suggestion will not advance us," demurred Tricotrin. "We shall, on the contrary, examine
the situation in all its bearings. Listen! Claudine is to enact the waiting-maid in _La Curieuse,_
which will be revived at the Comédie Moderne in a fortnight's time; she will dust the Empire
furniture, and say 'Yes' and 'No' with all the intellect and animation for which those
monosyllables provide an opening. Have you grasped the synopsis so far? Good! On the
strength of this performance, it has to be stated by the foremost dramatic critic in Paris that she
is an actress of genius. Now, how is it to be done? How shall we induce Labaregue to write of
her with an outburst of enthusiasm in _La Voix_?"
"Labaregue?" faltered Pitou. "I declare the audacity of your notion wakes me up!"
"Capital," said Tricotrin, "we are making progress already! Yes, we must have Labaregue--it has
never been my custom to do things by halves. Dramatically, of course, I should hold a
compromising paper of Labaregue's. I should say, 'Monsieur, the price of this document is an
act of justice to mademoiselle Claudine Hilairet. It is agreed? Good! Sit down--you will write from
my dictation!'"
"However--" said Pitou.
"However--I anticipate your objection--I do not hold such a paper. Therefore, that scene is cut.
Well, let us find another! Where is your fertility of resource? Mon Dieu! why should I speak to
him at all?"
"I do not figure myself that you will speak to him, you will never get the chance."
"Precisely my own suspicion. What follows? Instead of wasting my time seeking an interview
which would not be granted--"
"And which would lead to nothing even if it were granted!"
"And which would lead to nothing even if it were granted, as you point out; instead of doing this,
it is evident that I must write Labaregue's criticism myself!"
"Hein?" ejaculated Pitou, sitting up in bed.
"I confess that I do not perceive yet how it is to be managed, but obviously it is the only course.
 64 / 166

_I_ must write what is to be said, and _La Voix_ must believe that it has been written by
Labaregue. Come, we are getting on famously--we have now decided what we are to avoid!"
"By D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis," cried Pitou, "this will be the doughtiest adventure
in which we have engaged!"
"You are right, it is an adventure worthy of our steel ... pens! We shall enlighten the public,
crown an artiste, and win her heart by way of reward--that is to say, _I_ shall win her heart by
way of reward. What your own share of the booty will be I do not recognize, but I promise you,
at least, a generous half of the dangers."
"My comrade," murmured Pitou; "ever loyal! But do you not think that _La Voix_ will smell a rat?
What about the handwriting?"
"It is a weak point which had already presented itself to me. Could I have constructed the
situation to my liking, Labaregue would have the custom to type-write his notices; however, as
he is so inconsiderate as to knock them off in the Café de l'Europe, he has not that custom, and
we must adapt ourselves to the circumstances that exist. The probability is that a criticism
delivered by the accredited messenger, and signed with the familiar 'J.L.' will be passed without
question; the difference in the handwriting may be attributed to an amanuensis. When the great
man writes his next notice, I shall make it my business to be taking a bock in the Café de
l'Europe, in order that I may observe closely what happens. There is to be a répétition générale
at the Vaudeville on Monday night--on Monday night, therefore, I hope to advise you of our plan
of campaign. Now do not speak to me any more--I am about to compose a eulogy on Claudine,
for which Labaregue will, in due course, receive the credit."
The poet fell asleep at last, murmuring dithyrambic phrases; and if you suppose that in the
soberness of daylight he renounced his harebrained project, it is certain that you have never
lived with Tricotrin in Montmartre.
No, indeed, he did not renounce it. On Monday night--or rather in the small hours of Tuesday
morning--he awoke Pitou with enthusiasm.
"Mon vieux," he exclaimed, "the evening has been well spent! I have observed, and I have
reflected. When he quitted the Vaudeville, Labaregue entered the Café de l'Europe, seated
himself at his favourite table, and wrote without cessation for half an hour. When his critique
was finished, he placed it in an envelope, and commanded his supper. All this time I, sipping a
bock leisurely, accorded to his actions a scrutiny worthy of the secret police. Presently a lad
from the office of _La Voix_ appeared; he approached Labaregue, received the envelope, and
departed. At this point, my bock was finished; I paid for it and sauntered out, keeping the boy
well in view. His route to the office lay through a dozen streets which were all deserted at so late
an hour; but I remarked one that was even more forbidding than the rest--a mere alley that
seemed positively to have been designed for our purpose. Our course is clear--we shall attack
him in the rue des Cendres."
"Really?" inquired Pitou, somewhat startled.
"But really! We will not shed his blood; we will make him turn out his pockets, and then,
disgusted by the smallness of the swag, toss it back to him with a flip on the ear. Needless to

say that when he escapes, he will be the bearer of _my_ criticism, not of Labaregue's. He will
have been too frightened to remark the exchange."
"It is not bad, your plan."
"It is an inspiration. But to render it absolutely safe, we must have an accomplice."
"Why, is he so powerful, your boy?"
"No, mon ami, the boy is not so powerful, but the alley has two ends--I do not desire to be
arrested while I am giving a lifelike representation of an apache. I think we will admit Lajeunie to
our scheme--as a novelist he should appreciate the situation. If Lajeunie keeps guard at one
end of the alley, while you stand at the other, I can do the business without risk of being
interrupted and removed to gaol."
"It is true. As a danger signal, I shall whistle the first bars of my Fugue."
"Good! And we will arrange a signal with Lajeunie also. Mon Dieu! will not Claudine be amazed
next day? I shall not breathe a word to her in the meantime; I shall let her open _La Voix_
without expectation; and then--ah, what joy will be hers! 'The success of the evening was made
by the actress who took the role of the maidservant, and who had perhaps six words to utter.
But with what vivacity, with what esprit were they delivered! Every gesture, every sparkle of the
eyes, betokened the comedienne. For myself, I ceased to regard the fatuous ingénue, I forgot
the presence of the famous leading lady; I watched absorbed the facial play of this maidservant,
whose brains and beauty, I predict, will speedily bring Paris to her feet'!"
"Is that what you mean to write?"
"I shall improve upon it. I am constantly improving--that is why the notice is still unfinished. It
hampers me that I must compose in the strain of Labaregue himself, instead of allowing my
eloquence to soar. By the way, we had better speak to Lajeunie on the subject soon, lest he
should pretend that he has another engagement for that night; he is a good boy, Lajeunie, but
he always pretends that he has engagements in fashionable circles."
The pair went to him the following day, and when they had climbed to his garret, found the
young literary man in bed.
"It shocks me," said Pitou, "to perceive that you rise so late, Lajeunie; why are you not dashing
off chapters of a romance?"
"Mon Dieu!" replied Lajeunie, "I was making studies among the beau monde until a late hour
last night at a reception; and, to complete my fatigue, it was impossible to get a cab when I left."
"Naturally; it happens to everybody when he lacks a cab-fare," said Tricotrin. "Now tell me, have
you any invitation from a duchess for next Thursday evening?"
"Thursday, Thursday?" repeated Lajeunie thoughtfully. "No, I believe that I am free for
Thursday."

"Now, that is fortunate!" exclaimed Tricotrin. "Well, we want you to join us on that evening, my
friend."
"Indeed, we should be most disappointed if you could not," put in Pitou.
"Certainly; I shall have much pleasure," said Lajeunie. "Is it a supper?"
"No," said Tricotrin, "it is a robbery. I shall explain. Doubtless you know the name of
'mademoiselle Claudine Hilairet'?"
"I have never heard it in my life. Is she in Society?"
"Society? She is in the Comédie Moderne. She is a great actress, but-- like us
all--unrecognised."
"My heart bleeds for her. Another comrade!"
"I was sure I could depend upon your sympathy. Well, on Thursday night they will revive _La
Curieuse_ at the Comédie, and I myself propose to write Labaregue's critique of the
performance. Do you tumble?"
"It is a gallant action. Yes, I grasp the climax, but at present I do not perceive how the plot is to
be constructed."
"Labaregue's notices are dispatched by messenger," began Pitou.
"From the Café de l'Europe," added Tricotrin.
"So much I know," said Lajeunie.
"I shall attack the messenger, and make a slight exchange of manuscripts," Tricotrin went on.
"A blunder!" proclaimed Lajeunie; "you show a lack of invention. Now be guided by me, because
I am a novelist and I understand these things. The messenger is an escaped convict, and you
say to him, 'I know your secret. You do my bidding, or you go back to the galleys; I shall give
you three minutes to decide!' You stand before him, stern, dominant, inexorable--your watch in
your hand."
"It is at the pawn-shop."
"Well, well, of course it is; since when have you joined the realists? Somebody else's watch--or
a clock. Are there no clocks in Paris? You say, 'I shall give you until the clock strikes the hour.'
That is even more literary--you obtain the solemn note of the clock to mark the crisis."
"But there is no convict," demurred Tricotrin; "there are clocks, but there is no convict."
"No convict? The messenger is not a convict?"

"Not at all--he is an apple-cheeked boy."
"Oh, it is a rotten plot," said Lajeunie; "I shall not collaborate in it!"
"Consider!" cried Tricotrin; "do not throw away the chance of a lifetime, think what I offer
you--you shall hang about the end of a dark alley, and whistle if anybody comes. How literary
again is that! You may develop it into a novel that will make you celebrated. Pitou will be at the
other end. I and the apple-cheeked boy who is to die-- that is to say, to be duped--will occupy
the centre of the stage--I mean the middle of the alley. And on the morrow, when all Paris rings
with the fame of Claudine Hilairet, I, who adore her, shall have won her heart!"
"Humph," said Lajeunie. "Well, since the synopsis has a happy ending, I consent. But I make
one condition--I must wear a crêpe mask. Without a crêpe mask I perceive no thrill in my rôle."
"Madness!" objected Pitou. "Now listen to _me_--I am serious-minded, and do not commit
follies, like you fellows. Crêpe masks are not being worn this season. Believe me, if you loiter at
a street corner with a crêpe mask on, some passer-by will regard you, he may even wonder
what you are doing there. It might ruin the whole job."
"Pitou is right," announced Tricotrin, after profound consideration.
"Well, then," said Lajeunie, "_you_ must wear a crêpe mask! Put it on when you attack the boy.
I have always had a passion for crêpe masks, and this is the first opportunity that I find to gratify
it. I insist that somebody wears a crêpe mask, or I wash my hands of the conspiracy."
"Agreed! In the alley it will do no harm; indeed it will prevent the boy identifying me. Good, on
Thursday night then! In the meantime we shall rehearse the crime assiduously, and you and
Pitou can practise your whistles."
With what diligence did the poet write each day now! How lovingly he selected his superlatives!
Never in the history of the Press had such ardent care been lavished on a criticism--truly it was
not until Thursday afternoon that he was satisfied that he could do no more. He put the pages in
his pocket, and, too impatient even to be hungry, roamed about the quartier, reciting to himself
the most hyperbolic of his periods.
And dusk gathered over Paris, and the lights sprang out, and the tense hours crept away.
It was precisely half-past eleven when the three conspirators arrived at the doors of the
Comédie Moderne, and lingered near by until the audience poured forth. Labaregue was among
the first to appear. He paused on the steps to take a cigarette, and stepped briskly into the
noise and glitter of the Boulevard. The young men followed, exchanging feverish glances. Soon
the glow of the Café de l'Europe was visible. The critic entered, made a sign to a waiter, and
seated himself gravely at a table.
Many persons gazed at him with interest. To those who did not know, habitués whispered,
"There is Labaregue--see, he comes to write his criticism on the revival of _La Curieuse_!"
Labaregue affected unconsciousness of all this, but secretly he lapped it up. Occasionally he
passed his hand across his brow with a gesture profoundly intellectual.

Few there remarked that at brief intervals three shabby young men strolled in, who betrayed no
knowledge of one another, and merely called for bocks. None suspected that these humble
customers plotted to consign the celebrity's criticism to the flames.
Without a sign of recognition, taciturn and impassive, the three young men waited, their eyes
bent upon the critic's movements.
By-and-by Labaregue thrust his "copy" into an envelope that was provided. Some moments
afterwards one of the young men asked another waiter for the materials to write a letter. The
paper he crumpled in his pocket; in the envelope he placed the forged critique.
A quarter of an hour passed. Then a youth of about sixteen hurried in and made his way to
Labaregue's table. At this instant Lajeunie rose and left. As the youth received the "copy,"
Tricotrin also sauntered out. When the youth again reached the door, it was just swinging
behind Pitou.
The conspirators were now in the right order--Lajeunie pressing forward, Tricotrin keeping pace
with the boy, Pitou a few yards in the rear.
The boy proceeded swiftly. It was late, and even the Boulevard showed few pedestrians now; in
the side streets the quietude was unbroken. Tricotrin whipped on his mask at the opening of the
passage. When the messenger was half-way through it, the attack was made suddenly, with
determination.
"Fat one," exclaimed the poet, "I starve--give me five francs!"
"_Comment?_" stammered the youth, jumping; "I haven't five francs, I!"
"Give me all you have--empty your pockets, let me see! If you obey, I shall not harm you; if you
resist, you are a dead boy!"
The youth produced, with trepidation, a sou, half a cigarette, a piece of string, a murderous
clasp knife, a young lady's photograph, and Labaregue's notice. The next moment the exchange
of manuscripts had been deftly accomplished.
"Devil take your rubbish," cried the apache; "I want none of it--there! Be off, or I shall shoot you
for wasting my time."
The whole affair had occupied less than a minute; and the three adventurers skipped to
Montmartre rejoicing.
And how glorious was their jubilation in the hour when they opened _La Voix_ and read
Tricotrin's pronouncement over the initials "J.L."! There it was, printed word for word--the
leading lady was dismissed with a line, the ingénue received a sneer, and for the rest, the
column was a panegyric of the waiting-maid! The triumph of the waiting-maid was
unprecedented and supreme. Certainly, when Labaregue saw the paper, he flung round to the
office furious.
But _La Voix_ did not desire people to know that it had been taken in; so the matter was hushed
 69 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
up, and Labaregue went about pretending that he actually thought all those fine things of the
waiting-maid.
The only misfortune was that when Tricotrin called victoriously upon Claudine, to clasp her in his
arms, he found her in hysterics on the sofa--and it transpired that she had not represented the
waiting-maid after all. On the contrary, she had at the last moment been promoted to the part of
the ingénue, while the waiting-maid had been played by a little actress whom she much disliked.
"It is cruel, it is monstrous, it is heartrending!" gasped Tricotrin, when he grasped the enormity of
his failure; "but, light of my life, why should you blame _me_ for this villainy of Labaregue's?"
"I do not know," she said; "however, you bore me, you and your 'influence with the Press.' Get
out!"
THE DOLL IN THE PINK SILK DRESS
How can I write the fourth Act with this ridiculous thing posed among my papers? What thing? It
is a doll in a pink silk dress--an elaborate doll that walks, and talks, and warbles snatches from
the operas. A terrible lot it cost! Why does an old dramatist keep a doll on his study table? I do
not keep it there. It came in a box from the Boulevard an hour ago, and I took it from its
wrappings to admire its accomplishments again--and ever since it has been reminding me that
women are strange beings.
Yes, women are strange, and this toy sets me thinking of one woman in particular: that woman
who sued, supplicated for my help, and then, when she had all my interest--Confound the doll;
here is the incident, just as it happened!
It happened when all Paris flocked to see my plays and "Paul de Varenne" was a name to
conjure with. Fashions change. To-day I am a little out of the running, perhaps; younger men
have shot forward. In those days I was still supreme, I was master of the Stage.
Listen! It was a spring morning, and I was lolling at my study window, scenting the lilac in the
air. Maximin, my secretary, came in and said:
"Mademoiselle Jeanne Laurent asks if she can see you, monsieur."
"Who is mademoiselle Jeanne Laurent?" I inquired.
"She is an actress begging for an engagement, monsieur."
"I regret that I am exceedingly busy. Tell her to write."
"The lady has already written a thousand times," he mentioned, going. "'Jeanne Laurent' has
been one of the most constant contributors to our waste-paper basket."
"Then tell her that I regret I can do nothing for her. Mon Dieu! is it imagined that I have no other
occupation than to interview nonentities? By the way, how is it you have bothered me about her,
why this unusual embassy? I suppose she is pretty, hein?"

"Yes, monsieur."
"And young?"
"Yes, monsieur."
I wavered. Let us say my sympathy was stirred. But perhaps the lilac was responsible--lilac and
a pretty girl seem to me a natural combination, like coffee and a cigarette. "Send her in!" I said.
I sat at the table and picked up a pen.
"Monsieur de Varenne--" She paused nervously on the threshold.
Maximin was a fool, she was not "pretty"; she was either plain, or beautiful. To my mind, she
had beauty, and if she hadn't been an actress come to pester me for a part I should have
foreseen a very pleasant quarter of an hour. "I can spare you only a moment, mademoiselle," I
said, ruffling blank paper.
"It is most kind of you to spare me that."
I liked her voice too. "Be seated," I said more graciously.
"Monsieur, I have come to implore you to do something for me. I am breaking my heart in the
profession for want of a helping hand. Will you be generous and give me a chance?"
"My dear mademoiselle--er--Laurent," I said, "I sympathise with your difficulties, and I
thoroughly understand them, but I have no engagement to offer you--I am not a manager."
She smiled bitterly. "You are de Varenne--a word from you would 'make' me!"
I was wondering what her age was. About eight-and-twenty, I thought, but alternately she
looked much younger and much older.
"You exaggerate my influence--like every other artist that I consent to see. Hundreds have sat in
that chair and cried that I could 'make' them. It is all bosh. Be reasonable! I cannot 'make'
anybody."
"You could cast me for a part in Paris. You are 'not a manager,' but any manager will engage a
woman that you recommend. Oh, I know that hundreds appeal to you, I know that I am only one
of a crowd; but, monsieur, think what it means to me! Without help, I shall go on knocking at the
stage doors of Paris and never get inside; I shall go on writing to the Paris managers and never
get an answer. Without help I shall go on eating my heart out in the provinces till I am old and
tired and done for!"
Her earnestness touched me. I had heard the same tale so often that I was sick of hearing it,
but this woman's earnestness touched me. If I had had a small part vacant, I would have tried
her in it.
"Again," I said, "as a dramatist I fully understand the difficulties of an actress's career; but you,
 71 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
as an actress, do not understand a dramatist's. There is no piece of mine going into rehearsal
now, therefore I have no opening for you, myself; and it is impossible for me to write to a
manager or a brother author, advising him to entrust a part, even the humblest, to a lady of
whose capabilities I know nothing."
"I am not applying for a humble part," she answered quietly.
"Hein?"
"My line is lead."
I stared at her pale face, speechless; the audacity of the reply took my breath away.
"You are mad," I said, rising.
"I sound so to you, monsieur?"
"Stark, staring mad. You bewail that you are at the foot of the ladder, and at the same instant
you stipulate that I shall lift you at a bound to the top. Either you are a lunatic, or you are an
amateur."
She, too, rose--resigned to her dismissal, it seemed. Then, suddenly, with a gesture that was a
veritable abandonment of despair, she laughed.
"That's it, I am an amateur!" she rejoined passionately. "I will tell you the kind of 'amateur' I am,
monsieur de Varenne! I was learning my business in a fit-up when I was six years old--yes, I
was playing parts on the road when happier children were playing games in nurseries. I was
thrust on for lead when I was a gawk of fifteen, and had to wrestle with half a dozen roles in a
week, and was beaten if I failed to make my points. I have supered to stars, not to earn the few
francs I got by it, for by that time the fit-ups paid me better, but that I might observe, and
improve my method. I have waited in the rain, for hours, at the doors of the milliners and
modistes, that I might note how great ladies stepped from their carriages and spoke to their
footmen--and when I snatched a lesson from their aristocratic tones I was in heaven, though my
feet ached and the rain soaked my wretched clothes. I have played good women and bad
women, beggars and queens, ingénues and hags. I was born and bred on the stage, have
suffered and starved on it. It is my life and my destiny." She sobbed. "An 'amateur'!"
I could not let her go like that. She interested me strongly; somehow I believed in her. I strode to
and fro, considering.
"Sit down again," I said. "I will do this for you: I will go to the country to see your performance.
When is your next show?"
"I have nothing in view."
"Bigre! Well, the next time you are playing, write to me."
"You will have forgotten all about me," she urged feverishly, "or your interest will have faded, or
Fate will prevent your coming."

"Why do you say so?"
"Something tells me. You will help me now, or you will never help me-- my chance is to-day!
Monsieur, I entreat you--"
"To-day I can do nothing at all, because I have not seen you act."
"I could recite to you."
"Zut!"
"I could rehearse on trial."
"And if you made a mess of it? A nice fool I should look, after fighting to get you in!"
A servant interrupted us to tell me that my old friend de Lavardens was downstairs. And now I
did a foolish thing. When I intimated to mademoiselle Jeanne Laurent that our interview must
conclude, she begged so hard to be allowed to speak to me again after my visitor went, that I
consented to her waiting. Why? I had already said all that I had to say, and infinitely more than I
had contemplated. Perhaps she impressed me more powerfully than I realised; perhaps it was
sheer compassion, for she had an invincible instinct that if I sent her away at this juncture, she
would never hear from me any more. I had her shown into the next room, and received General
de Lavardens in the study.
Since his retirement from the Army, de Lavardens had lived in his chateau at St. Wandrille, in
the neighbourhood of Caudebec-en-Caux, and we had met infrequently of late. But we had
been at college together; I had entered on my military service in the same regiment as he; and
we had once been comrades. I was glad to see him.
"How are you, my dear fellow? I didn't know you were in Paris."
"I have been here twenty-four hours," he said. "I have looked you up at the first opportunity.
Now am I a nuisance? Be frank! I told the servant that if you were at work you weren't to be
disturbed. Don't humbug about it; if I am in the way, say so!"
"You are not in the way a bit," I declared. "Put your hat and cane down. What's the news? How
is Georges?"
"Georges" was Captain de Lavardens, his son, a young man with good looks, and brains, an
officer for whom people predicted a brilliant future.
"Georges is all right," he said hesitatingly. "He is dining with me to-night. I want you to come,
too, if you can. Are you free?"
"To-night? Yes, certainly; I shall be delighted."
"That was one of the reasons I came round--to ask you to join us." He glanced towards the table
again. "Are you sure you are not in a hurry to get back to that?"

"Have a cigar, and don't be a fool. What have you got to say for yourself? Why are you on the
spree here?"
"I came up to see Georges," he said. "As a matter of fact, my dear chap, I am devilish worried."
"Not about Georges?" I asked, surprised.
He grunted. "About Georges."
"Really? I'm very sorry."
"Yes. I wanted to talk to you about it. You may be able to give me a tip. Georges--the boy I
hoped so much for"--his gruff voice quivered-- "is infatuated with an actress."
"Georges?"
"What do you say to that?"
"Are you certain it is true?"
"True? He makes no secret of it. That isn't all. The idiot wants to marry her!"
"Georges wants to marry an actress?"
"Voilà!"
"My dear old friend!" I stammered.
"Isn't it amazing? One thinks one knows the character of one's own son, hein? And then,
suddenly, a boy--a boy? A man! Georges will soon be thirty--a man one is proud of, who is
distinguishing himself in his profession, he loses his head about some creature of the theatre
and proposes to mar his whole career."
"As for that, it might not mar it," I said.
"We are not in England, in France gentlemen do not choose their wives from the stage! I can
speak freely to you; you move among these people because your writing has taken you among
them, but you are not of their breed,"
"Have you reasoned with him?"
"Reasoned? Yes."
"What did he say?"
"Prepare to be amused. He said that 'unfortunately, the lady did not love him'!"
"What? Then there is no danger?"

"Do you mean to say that it takes you in? You may be sure her 'reluctance' is policy, she thinks
it wise to disguise her eagerness to hook him. He told me plainly that he would not rest till he
had won her. It is a nice position! The honour of the family is safe only till this adventuress
consents, _consents_ to accept his hand! What can I do? I can retard the marriage by refusing
my permission, but I cannot prevent it, if he summons me.... Of course, if I could arrange
matters with her, I would do it like a shot--at any price!"
"Who is she?"
"A nobody; he tells me she is quite obscure, I don't suppose you have ever heard of her. But I
thought you might make inquiries for me, that you might ascertain whether she is the sort of
woman we could settle with?"
"I will do all I can, you may depend. Where is she--in Paris?"
"Yes, just now."
"What's her name?"
"Jeanne Laurent."
My mouth fell open: "Hein?"
"Do you know her?"
"She is there!"
"What?"
"In the next room. She just called on business."
"Mon Dieu! That's queer!"
"It's lucky. It was the first time I had ever met her."
"What's she like?"
"Have you never seen her? You shall do so in a minute. She came to beg me to advance her
professionally, she wants my help. This ought to save you some money, my friend. We'll have
her in! I shall tell her who you are."
"How shall I talk to her?"
"Leave it to me."
I crossed the landing, and opened the salon door. The room was littered with the illustrated
journals, but she was not diverting herself with any of them--she was sitting before a copy of
_La Joconde_, striving to reproduce on her own face the enigma of the smile: I had discovered
an actress who never missed an opportunity.

"Please come here."
She followed me back, and my friend stood scowling at her.
"This gentleman is General de Lavardens," I said.
She bowed--slightly, perfectly. That bow acknowledged de Lavardens' presence, and rebuked
the manner of my introduction, with all the dignity of the patricians whom she had studied in the
rain.
"Mademoiselle, when my servant announced that the General was downstairs you heard the
name. You did not tell me that you knew his son."
"Dame, non, monsieur!" she murmured.
"And when you implored me to assist you, you did not tell me that you aspired to a marriage that
would compel you to leave the stage. I never waste my influence. Good-morning!"
"I do not aspire to the marriage," she faltered, pale as death.
"Rubbish, I know all about it. Of course, it is your aim to marry him sooner or later, and of
course he will make it a condition that you cease to act. Well, I have no time to help a woman
who is playing the fool! That's all about it. I needn't detain you."
"I have refused to marry him," she gasped. "On my honour! You can ask him. It is a fact."
"But you see him still," broke in de Lavardens wrathfully; "he is with you every day! That is a
fact, too, isn't it? If your refusal is sincere, why are you not consistent? why do you want him at
your side?"
"Because, monsieur," she answered, "I am weak enough to miss him when he goes."
"Ah! you admit it. You profess to be in love with him?"
"No, monsieur," she dissented thoughtfully, "I am not in love with him --and my refusal has been
quite sincere, incredible as it may seem that a woman like myself rejects a man like him. I could
never make a marriage that would mean death to my ambition. I could not sacrifice my art--the
stage is too dear to me for that. So it is evident that I am not in love with him, for when a woman
loves, the man is dearer to her than all else."
De Lavardens grunted. I knew his grunts: there was some apology in this one.
"The position is not fair to my son," he demurred. "You show good sense in what you say--you
are an artist, you are quite right to devote yourself to your career; but you reject and encourage
him at the same time. If he married you it would be disastrous--to you, and to him; you would
ruin his life, and spoil your own. Enfin, give him a chance to forget you! Send him away. What
do you want to keep seeing him for?"
She sighed. "It is wrong of me, I own!"

"It is highly unnatural," said I.
"No, monsieur; it is far from being unnatural, and I will tell you why --he is the only man I have
ever known, in all my vagabond life, who realised that a struggling actress might have the soul
of a gentlewoman. Before I met him, I had never heard a man speak to me with courtesy,
excepting on the stage; I had never known a man to take my hand respectfully when he was not
performing behind the footlights.... I met him first in the country; I was playing the Queen in
_Ruy Blas_, and the manager brought him to me in the wings. In everything he said and did he
was different from others. We were friends for months before he told me that he loved me. His
friendship has been the gift of God, to brighten my miserable lot. Never to see him any more
would be awful to me!"
I perceived that if she was not in love with him she was so dangerously near to it that a trifle
might turn the scale. De Lavardens had the same thought. His glance at me was apprehensive.
"However, you acknowledge that you are behaving badly!" I exclaimed. "It is all right for _you_,
friendship is enough for you, and you pursue your career. But for _him_, it is different; he seeks
your love, and he neglects his duties. For him to spend his life sighing for you would be
monstrous, and for him to marry you would be fatal. If you like him so much, be just to him, set
him free! Tell him that he is not to visit you any more."
"He does not visit me; he has never been inside my lodging."
"Well, that he is not to write there--that there are to be no more dinners, drives, bouquets!"
"And I do not let him squander money on me. I am not that kind of woman."
"We do not accuse you, mademoiselle. On the contrary, we appeal to your good heart. Be
considerate, be brave! Say good-bye to him!"
"You are asking me to suffer cruelly," she moaned.
"It is for your friend's benefit. Also, the more you suffer, the better you will act. Every actress
should suffer."
"Monsieur, I have served my apprenticeship to pain."
"There are other things than friendship--you have your prospects to think about."
"What prospects?" she flashed back.
"Well, I cannot speak definitely to-day, as you know; but you would not find me unappreciative."
De Lavardens grunted again--emotionally, this time. I checked him with a frown.
"What use would it be for me to refuse to see him?" she objected chokily. "When I am playing
anywhere, _he_ can always see _me_. I cannot kill his love by denying myself his
companionship. Besides, he would not accept the dismissal. One night, when I left the theatre, I
should find him waiting there again."

This was unpalatably true.
"If a clever woman desires to dismiss a man, she can dismiss him thoroughly, especially a
clever actress," I said. "You could talk to him in such a fashion that he would have no wish to
meet you again. Such things have been done."
"What? You want me to teach him to despise me?"
"Much better if he did!"
"To turn his esteem to scorn, hein?"
"It would be a generous action."
"To falsify and degrade myself?"
"For your hero's good!"
"I will not do it!" she flamed. "You demand too much. What have _you_ done for _me_ that I
should sacrifice myself to please you? I entreat your help, and you give me empty phrases; I cry
that I despair this morning, and you answer that by-and-by, some time, in the vague future, you
will remember that I exist. I shall not do this for you--I keep my friend!"
"Your rhetoric has no weight with me," I said. "I do not pretend that I have a claim on you. In
such circumstances a noble woman would take the course I suggest, not for my sake, not for
the sake of General de Lavardens, but for the sake of the man himself. You will 'keep your
friend'? Bien! But you will do so because you are indifferent to his welfare and too selfish to
release him."
She covered her face. There were tears on it. The General and I exchanged glances again.
I went on:
"You charge me with giving you only empty phrases. That is undeserved. I said all that was
possible, and I meant what I said. I could not pledge myself to put you into anything without
knowing what you are capable of doing; but, if you retain my good will, I repeat that I will attend
your next performance."
"And then?" she queried.
"Then--if I think well of it--you shall have a good part."
"Lead?"
"Bigre! I cannot say that. A good part, in Paris!"
"It is a promise?"
"Emphatically--if I think well of your performance."

"Of my next--the very next part I play?"
"Of the very next part you play."
She paused, reflecting. The pause lasted so long that it began to seem to my suspense as if
none of us would ever speak again. I took a cigarette, and offered the box, in silence, to de
Lavardens. He shook his head without turning it to me, his gaze was riveted on the woman.
"All right," she groaned, "I agree!"
"Ah! good girl!"
"All you require is that Captain de Lavardens shall no longer seek me for his wife. Is that it?"
"That's it."
"Very well. I know what would repel him--it shall be done to-night. But you, gentlemen, will have
to make the opportunity for me; you will have to bring him to my place--both of you. You can find
some reason for proposing it? Tonight at nine o'clock. He knows the address."
She moved weakly to the door.
De Lavardens took three strides and grasped her hands. "Mademoiselle," he stuttered, "I have
no words to speak my gratitude. I am a father, and I love my son, but--mon Dieu! if--if things had
been different, upon my soul, I should have been proud to call you my daughter-in-law!"
Oh, how she could bow, that woman--the eloquence of her ill-fed form!
"Au revoir, gentlemen," she said.
Phew! We dropped into chairs.
"Paul," he grunted at me, "we have been a pair of brutes!"
"I know it. But you feel much relieved?"
"I feel another man. What is she going to say to him? I wish it were over. _I_ should find it
devilish difficult to propose going to see her, you know! It will have to be _your_ suggestion. And
supposing he won't take us?"
"He will take us right enough," I declared, "and rejoice at the chance. Hourra! hourra! hourra!" I
sprang up and clapped him on the back. "My friend, if that woman had thrown herself away on
Georges it might have been a national calamity."
"What?" he roared, purpling.
"Oh, no slight to Georges! I think--I think--I am afraid to say what I think, I am afraid to think it!" I
paced the room, struggling to control myself. "Only, once in a blue moon, Jules, there is a
woman born of the People with a gift that is a blessing, and a curse--and her genius makes an

epoch, and her name makes theatrical history. And if a lover of the stage like me discovers such
a woman, you stodgy old soldier, and blazes her genius in his work, he feels like Cheops,
Chephrenus, and Asychis rearing the Pyramids for immortality!"
My excitement startled him. "You believe she is a genius? Really?"
"I dare not believe," I panted. "I refuse to let myself believe, for I have never seen blue moons.
But--but--I wonder!"
We dined at Voisin's. It had been arranged that he should make some allusion to the courtship;
and I said to Georges, "I hope you don't mind your father having mentioned the subject to
me--we are old friends, you know?" The topic was led up to very easily. It was apparent that
Georges thought the world of her. I admired the way he spoke. It was quiet and earnest. As I
feigned partial sympathy with his matrimonial hopes, I own that I felt a Judas.
"I, too, am an artist," I said. "To me social distinctions naturally seem somewhat less important
than they do to your father."
"Indeed, monsieur," he answered gravely, "mademoiselle Laurent is worthy of homage. If she
were willing to accept me, every man who knew her character would think me fortunate. Her
education has not qualified her to debate with professors, and she has no knowledge of society
small-talk, but she is intelligent, and refined, and good."
It was child's play. A sudden notion, over the liqueurs: "Take us to see her! Come along, mon
ami!" Astonishment (amateurish); persuasion (masterly); Georges's diffidence to intrude, but his
obvious delight at the thought of the favourable impression she would create. He had "never
called there yet--it would be very unconventional at such an hour?" "Zut, among artists! My card
"Fervently I wish that appearances were not deceptive!" said Tricotrin, who required little
persuasion. "Is it indiscreet to inquire to what griefs you allude? Upon my word, your position
appears a very pretty one! Where do those dainty shoes pinch you?"
"They are not easy on foreign soil, monsieur. When I reflect that you go back to-night, that tomorrow you will be again in Paris, I could gnash my teeth with jealousy."
"But, ma foi!" returned Tricotrin, "to a girl of brains, like yourself, Paris is always open. Are there
no customers for eyelashes in France? Why condemn yourself to gnash with jealousy when
there is a living to be earned at home?"
"There are several reasons," she said; "for one thing, I am an extravagant little hussy and
haven't saved enough for a ticket."
"I have heard no reason yet! At the moment my pocket is nicely lined-- you might return with me
this evening,"
"Are you mad by any chance?" she laughed.
"It seems to me the natural course."
"Well, I should not be free to go like that, even if I took your money. I am a business woman,
you see, who does not sacrifice her interests to her sentiment. What is your own career,
monsieur Tricotrin?"
"I am a poet, And when I am back in Paris I shall write verse about you. It shall be an
impression of London--the great city as it reveals itself to a stranger whose eyes are dazzled by
the girl he loves."

"Forbidden ground!" she cried, admonishing him with a finger. "No dazzle!"
"I apologise," said Tricotrin; "you shall find me a poet of my word. Why, I declare," he exclaimed,
glancing from the window, "it has begun to rain!"
"Well, fortunately, we have plenty of time; there is all day for our excursion and we can wait for
the weather to improve. If you do not object to smoking while I sing, monsieur, I propose a little
music to go on with."
And it turned out that this singular assistant of a hairdresser had a very sympathetic voice, and
no contemptible repertoire. Although the sky had now broken its promise shamefully and the
downpour continued, Tricotrin found nothing to complain of. By midday one would have said
that they had been comrades for years. By luncheon both had ceased even to regard the rain.
And before evening approached, they had confided to each other their histories from the day of
their birth.
Ascertaining that the basement boasted a smudgy servant girl, who was to be dispatched for
entrées and sauterne, Tricotrin drew up the menu of a magnificent dinner as the climax. It was
conceded that at this repast he should be the host; and having placed him on oath behind a
screen, Rosalie proceeded to make an elaborate toilette in honour of his entertainment.
Determined, as he had said, to prove himself a poet of his word, the young man remained
behind the screen as motionless as a waxwork, but the temptation to peep was tremendous,
and at the whispering of a silk petticoat he was unable to repress a groan.
"What ails you?" she demanded, the whispering suspended.
"I merely expire with impatience to meet you again."
"Monsieur, I am hastening to the trysting-place, And my costume will be suitable to the
occasion, believe me!"
"In that case, if you are not quick, you will have to wear crape. However, proceed, I can suffer
with the best of them.... Are you certain that I can be of no assistance? I feel selfish, idling here
like this. Besides, since I am able to see--"
"See?" she screamed.
"--see no reason why you should refuse my aid, my plight is worse still. What are you doing
now?"
"My hair," she announced.
"Surely it would not be improper for me to view a head of hair?"
"Perhaps not, monsieur; but my head is on my shoulders--which makes a difference."
"Mademoiselle," sighed Tricotrin, "never have I known a young lady whose head was on her
shoulders more tightly. May I crave one indulgence? My imprisonment would be less painful for

a cigarette, and I cannot reach the matches--will you consent to pass them round the screen?"
"It is against the rules. But I will consent to throw them over the top. Catch! Why don't you say
'thank you'?"
"Because your unjust suspicion killed me; I now need nothing but immortelles, and at dinner I
will compose my epitaph. If I am not mistaken, I already smell the soup on the stairs."
And the soup had scarcely entered when his guest presented herself. Paquin and the Fairy
Godmother would have approved her gown; as to her coiffure, if her employer could have seen
it, he would have wanted to put her in his window. Tricotrin gave her his arm with stupefaction.
"Upon my word," he faltered, "you awe me. I am now overwhelmed with embarrassment that I
had the temerity to tease you while you dressed. And what shall I say of the host who is churl
enough to welcome you in such a shabby coat?"
The cork went pop, their tongues went nineteen to the dozen, and the time went so rapidly that
a little clock on the chest of drawers became a positive killjoy.
"By all the laws of dramatic effect," remarked the poet, as they trifled with the almonds and
raisins, "you will now divulge that the fashionable lady before me is no 'Rosalie Durand,' of a
hairdresser's shop, but madame la comtesse de Thrilling Mystery. Every novel reader would be
aware that at this stage you will demand some dangerous service of me, and that I shall
forthwith risk my life and win your love."
"Bien sûr! That is how it ought to be," she agreed.
"Is it impossible?"
"That I can be a countess?"
"Well, we will waive the 'countess'; and for that matter I will not insist on risking my life; but what
about the love?"
"Without the rest," she demurred, "the situation would be too commonplace. When I can tell you
that I am a countess I will say also that I love you; to-night I am Rosalie Durand, a friend. By the
way, now I come to think of it, I shall be all that you have seen in London!"
"Why, I declare, so you will!" exclaimed Tricotrin. "Really this is a nice thing! I come to England
for the benefit of my education--and when it is almost time for me to return, I find that I have
spent the whole of the day in a room."
"But you have, at least, had a unique experience in it?" she queried with a whimsical smile.
"Well, yes; my journey has certainly yielded an adventure that none of my acquaintances would
credit! Do you laugh at me?"
"Far from it; by-and-by I may even spare a tear for you--if you do not spoil the day by being
clumsy at the end."

"Ah, Rosalie," cried the susceptible poet, "how can I bear the parting? What is France without
you? I am no longer a Frenchman--my true home is now England! My heart will hunger for it, my
thoughts will stretch themselves to it across the sea; banished to Montmartre, I shall mourn daily
for the white cliffs of Albion, for Soho, and for you!"
"I, too, shall remember," she murmured. "But perhaps one of these days you will come to
England again?"
"If the fare could be paid with devotion, I would come every Sunday, but how can I hope to
amass enough money? Such things do not happen twice. No, I will not deceive myself--this is
our farewell. See!" He rose, and turned the little clock with its face to the wall. "When that clock
strikes, I must go to catch my train--in the meantime we will ignore the march of time. Farewells,
tears, regrets, let us forget that they exist--let us drink the last glass together gaily, mignonne!"
They pledged each other with brave smiles, hand in hand. And now their chatter became fast
and furious, to drown the clock's impatient tick.
The clockwork wheezed and whirred.
"'Tis going to part us," shouted Tricotrin; "laugh, laugh, Beloved, so that we may not hear!"
"Kiss me," she cried; "while the hour sounds, you shall hold me in your arms!"
"Heaven," gasped the young man, as the too brief embrace concluded, "how I wish it had been
striking midnight!"
The next moment came the separation. He descended the stairs; at the window she waved her
hand to him. And in the darkness of an "English hansom" the poet covered his face and wept.
* * * * *
"From our hearts we rejoice to have thee safely back!" they chorused in Montmartre. "And what
didst thou see in London?"
"Oh, mon Dieu, what noble sights!" exclaimed Tricotrin. "The Lor' Maire blazes with jewels like
the Shah of Persia; and compared with Peeccadeelly, the Champs Elysées are no wider than a
hatband. Vive l'Entente! Positively my brain whirls with all the splendours of London I have
seen!"
THE INFIDELITY OF MONSIEUR NOULENS
Whenever they talk of him, whom I will call "Noulens"--of his novels, his method, the
eccentricities of his talent--someone is sure to say, "But what comrades, he and his wife!"--you
are certain to hear it. And as often as I hear it myself, I think of what he told me that evening --I
remember the shock I had.
At the beginning, I had expected little. When I went in, his wife said, "I fear he will be poor
company; he has to write a short story for _La Voix,_ and cannot find a theme--he has been
beating his brains all day." So far, from anticipating emotions, I had proposed dining there
 158 / 166

https://www.fulltextarchive.com
another night instead, but she would not allow me to leave. "Something you say may suggest a
theme to him," she declared, "and he can write or dictate the story in an hour, when you have
gone."
So I stayed, and after dinner he lay on the sofa, bewailing the fate that had made him an author.
The salon communicated with his study, and through the open door he had the invitation of his
writing-table--the little sheaf of paper that she had put in readiness for him, the lighted lamp, the
pile of cigarettes. I knew that she hoped the view would stimulate him, but it was soon apparent
that he had ceased to think of a story altogether. He spoke of one of the latest murders in Paris,
one sensational enough for the Paris Press to report a murder prominently--of a conference at
the Université des Annales, of the artistry of Esther Lekain, of everything except his work. Then,
in the hall, the telephone bell rang, and madame Noulens rose to receive the message. "Allô!
Allô!"
She did not come back. There was a pause, and presently he murmured:
"I wonder if a stranger has been moved to telephone a plot to me?"
"What?" I said.
"It sounds mad, hein? But it once happened--on just such a night as this, when my mind was
just as blank. Really! Out of the silence a woman told me a beautiful story. Of course, I never
used it, nor do I know if she made use of it herself; but I have never forgotten. For years I could
not hear a telephone bell without trembling. Even now, when I am working late, I find myself
hoping for her voice."
"The story was so wonderful as that?"
He threw a glance into the study, as if to assure himself that his wife had not entered it from the
hall.
"Can you believe that a man may learn to love--tenderly and truly love --a woman he has never
met?" he asked me.
"I don't think I understand you."
"There has been only one woman in my life who was all in all to me," he said--"and I never saw
her."
How was I to answer? I looked at him.
"After all, what is there incredible in it?" he demanded. "Do we give our love to a face, or to a
temperament? I swear to you that I could not have known that woman's temperament more
intimately if we had made our confidences in each other's arms. I knew everything of her,
except the trifles which a stranger learns in the moment of being presented-- her height, her
complexion, her name, whether she was married or single. No, those things I never knew. But
her tastes, her sympathies, her soul, these, the secret truths of the woman, were as familiar to
me as to herself."

He hesitated.
"I am in a difficulty. If I seem to disparage my wife, I shall be a cad; if I let you think we have
been as happy together as people imagine, you will not understand the importance of what I am
going to tell you. I will say this: before our honeymoon was over, I bored her fearfully. While we
were engaged, I had talked to her of my illusions about herself; when we were married, I talked
to her of my convictions about my art. The change appalled her. She was chilled, crushed,
dumfounded. I looked to her to share my interests. For response, she yawned--and wept.
"Oh, her tears! her hourly tears! the tears that drowned my love!
"The philosopher is made, not born; in the first few years I rebelled furiously. I wanted a
companion, a confidant, and I had never felt so desperately alone.
"We had a flat in the rue de Sontay then, and the telephone was in my workroom. One night
late, as I sat brooding there, the bell startled me; and a voice--a woman's voice, said:
"'I am so lonely; I want to talk to you before I sleep.'
"I cannot describe the strangeness of that appeal, reaching me so suddenly out of the distance.
I knew that it was a mistake, of course, but it was as if, away in the city, some nameless soul
had echoed the cry in my own heart. I obeyed an impulse; I said:
"'I, too, am very lonely--I believe I have been waiting for you.'
"There was a pause, and then she asked, dismayed:
"'Who are you?'
"'Not the man you thought,' I told her. 'But a very wistful one.'
"I heard soft laughter, 'How absurd!' she murmured.
"'Be merciful,' I went on; 'we are both sad, and Fate clearly intends us to console each other. It
cannot compromise you, for I do not even know who you are. Stay and talk to me for five
minutes.'
"'What do you ask me to talk about?'
"'Oh, the subject to interest us both--yourself.'
"After a moment she answered, 'I am shaking my head.'
"'It is very unfeeling of you,' I said. 'And I have not even the compensation of seeing you do it.'
"Imagine another pause, and then her voice in my ear again:
"'I will tell you what I can do for you--I can tell you a story.'

"'The truth would please me more,' I owned. 'Still, if my choice must be made between your
story and your silence, I certainly choose the story.'
"'I applaud your taste,' she said. 'Are you comfortable--are you sitting down?'
"I sat down, smiling. 'Madame--'
"She did not reply.
"Then, 'Mademoiselle--'
"Again no answer.
"'Well, say at least if I have your permission to smoke while I listen to you?'
"She laughed: 'You carry courtesy far!'
"'How far?' I asked quickly.
"But she would not even hint from what neighbourhood she was speaking to me. 'Attend!' she
commanded--and began:
"'It is a story of two lovers,' she said, 'Paul and Rosamonde. They were to have married, but
Rosamonde died too soon. When she was dying, she gave him a curl of the beautiful brown hair
that he used to kiss. "Au revoir, dear love," she whispered; "it will be very stupid in Heaven until
you come. Remember that I am waiting for you and be faithful. If your love for me fades, you will
see that curl of mine fade too."
"'Every day through the winter Paul strewed flowers on her tomb, and sobbed. And in the spring
he strewed flowers and sighed. And in the summer he paid that flowers might be strewn there
for him. Sometimes, when he looked at the dead girl's hair, he thought that it was paler than it
had been, but, as he looked at it seldom now, he could easily persuade himself that he was
mistaken.
"'Then he met a woman who made him happy again; and the wind chased the withered flowers
from Rosamonde's grave and left it bare. One day Paul's wife found a little packet that lay
forgotten in his desk. She opened it jealously, before he could prevent her. Paul feared that the
sight would give her pain, and watched her with anxious eyes. But in a moment she was
laughing. "What an idiot I am," she exclaimed--"I was afraid that it was the hair of some girl you
had loved!" The curl was snow-white.'
"Her fantastic tale," continued Noulens, "which was told with an earnestness that I cannot
reproduce, impressed me very much. I did not offer any criticism, I did not pay her any
compliment; I said simply:
"'Who are you?'
"'That,' she warned me, 'is a question that you must not ask. Well, are you still bored?'

"'No.'
"'Interested, a little?'
"'Very much so.'
"'I, too, am feeling happier than I did. And now, bonsoir!'
"'Wait,' I begged. 'Tell me when I shall speak to you again.'
"She hesitated; and I assure you that I had never waited for a woman's answer with more
suspense while I held her hand, than I waited for the answer of this woman whom I could not
see. 'To-morrow?' I urged. 'In the morning?'
"'In the morning it would be difficult.'
"'The afternoon?'
"'In the afternoon it would be impossible,'
"'Then the evening--at the same hour?'
"'Perhaps,' she faltered--'if I am free.'
"'My number,' I told her, 'is five-four-two, one-nine. Can you write it now?'
"'I have written it.'
"'Please repeat, so that there may be no mistake.'
"'Five-four-two, one-nine. Correct?'
"'Correct. I am grateful.'
"'Good-night.'
"'Good-night. Sleep well.'
"You may suppose that on the morrow I remembered the incident with a smile, that I ridiculed
the emotion it had roused in me? You would be wrong. I recalled it more and more curiously: I
found myself looking forward to the appointment with an eagerness that was astonishing. We
had talked for about twenty minutes, hidden from each other--half Paris, perhaps, dividing us; I
had nothing more tangible to expect this evening. Yet I experienced all the sensations of a man
who waits for an interview, for an embrace. What did it mean? I was bewildered. The possibility
of love at first sight I understood; but might the spirit also recognise an affinity by telephone?
"There is a phrase in feuilletons that had always irritated me--'To his impatience it seemed that
the clock had stopped.' It had always struck me as absurd. Since that evening I have never
condemned the phrase, for honestly, I thought more than once that the clock had stopped. By-

and-by, to increase the tension, my wife, who seldom entered my workroom, opened the door.
She found me idle, and was moved to converse with me. Mon Dieu! Now that the hour
approached at last, my wife was present, with the air of having settled herself for the night!
"The hands of the clock moved on--and always faster now. If she remained till the bell rang,
what was I to do? To answer that I had 'someone with me' would be intelligible to the lady, but it
would sound suspicious to my wife. To answer that I was 'busy' would sound innocent to my
wife, but it would be insulting to the lady. To disregard the bell altogether would be to let my wife
go to the telephone herself! I tell you I perspired.
"Under Providence, our cook rescued me. There came a timid knock, and then the figure of the
cook, her eyes inflamed, her head swathed in some extraordinary garment. She had a raging
toothache--would madame have the kindness to give her a little cognac? The ailments of the
cook always arouse in human nature more solicitude than the ailments of any other servant. My
wife's sympathy was active--I was saved!
"The door had scarcely closed when _tr-rr-r-ng_ the signal came.
"'Good-evening,' from the voice. 'So you are here to meet me.'
"'Good-evening,' I said. 'I would willingly go further to meet you,'
"'Be thankful that the rendez-vous was your flat--listen to the rain! Come, own that you
congratulated yourself when it began! "Luckily I can be gallant without getting wet," you thought.
Really, I am most considerate--you keep a dry skin, you waste no time in reaching me, and you
need not even trouble to change your coat.'
"'It sounds very cosy,' I admitted, 'but there is one drawback to it all--I do not see you.'
"'That may be more considerate of me still! I may be reluctant to banish your illusions. Isn't it
probable that I am elderly--or, at least plain? I may even be a lady novelist, with ink on her
fingers. By-the-bye, monsieur, I have been rereading one of your books since last night.'
"'Oh, you know my name now? I am gratified to have become more than a telephonic address
to you. May I ask if we have ever met?'
"'We never spoke till last night, but I have seen you often,'
"'You, at any rate, can have no illusions to be banished. What a relief! I have endeavoured to
talk as if I had a romantic bearing; now that you know how I look, I can be myself.'
"'I await your next words with terror,' she said. 'What shock is in store for me? Speak gently.'
"'Well, speaking gently, I am very glad that you were put on to the wrong number last night. At
the same time, I feel a constraint, a difficulty; I cannot talk to you frankly, cannot be serious--it is
as if I showed my face while you were masked.'
"'Yes, it is true--I understand,' she said. 'And even if I were to swear that I was not unworthy of
your frankness, you would still be doubtful of me, I suppose?'

"'Madame--'
"'Oh, it is natural! I know very well how I must appear to you,' she exclaimed; 'a coquette, with a
new pastime--a vulgar coquette, besides, who tries to pique your interest by an air of mystery.
Believe me, monsieur, I am forbidden to unmask. Think lightly of me if you must--I have no right
to complain--but believe as much as that! I do not give you my name, simply because I may
not.'
"'Madame,' I replied, 'so far from wishing to force your confidences, I assure you that I will never
inquire who you are, never try to find out.'
"'And you will talk frankly, unconstrainedly, all the same?'
"'Ah, you are too illogical to be elderly and plain,' I demurred. 'You resolve to remain a stranger
to me, and I bow to your decision; but, on the other hand, a man makes confidences only to his
friends.'
"There was a long pause; and when I heard the voice again, it trembled:
"'Adieu, monsieur.'
"'Adieu, madame,' I said.
"No sooner had she gone than I would have given almost anything to bring her back. For a long
while I sat praying that she would ring again. I watched the telephone as if it had been her
window, the door of her home--something that could yield her to my view. During the next few
days I grudged every minute that I was absent from the room--I took my meals in it. Never had I
had the air of working so indefatigably, and in truth I did not write a line, 'I suppose you have
begun a new romance?' said my wife. In my soul I feared that I had finished it!"
Noulens sighed; he clasped his hands on his head. The dark hair, the thin, restless fingers were
all that I could see of him where I sat. Some seconds passed; I wondered whether there would
be time for me to hear the rest before his wife returned.
* * * * *
"In my soul I feared that I had finished it," he repeated. "Extraordinary as it appears, I was in
love with a woman I had never seen. Each time that bell sounded, my heart seemed to try to
choke me. It had been my grievance, since we had the telephone installed, that we heard
nothing of it excepting that we had to make another payment for its use; but now, by a
maddening coincidence, everybody that I had ever met took to ringing me up about trifles and
agitating me twenty times a day.
"At last, one night--when expectation was almost dead--she called to me again. Oh, but her
voice was humble! My friend, it is piteous when we love a woman, to hear her humbled. I longed
to take her hands, to fold my arms about her. I abased myself, that she might regain her pride.
She heard how I had missed and sorrowed for her; I owned that she was dear to me.
"And then began a companionship--strange as you may find the word-- which was the sweetest

my life has held. We talked together daily. This woman, whose whereabouts, whose face,
whose name were all unknown to me, became the confidant of my disappointments and my
hopes. If I worked well, my thoughts would be, 'Tonight I shall have good news to give her;' if I
worked ill--'Never mind, by-and-by she will encourage me!' There was not a page in my next
novel that I did not read to her; never a doubt beset me in which I did not turn for her sympathy
and advice.
"'Well, how have you got on?'
"'Oh, I am so troubled this evening, dear!'
"'Poor fellow! Tell me all about it. I tried to come to you sooner, but I couldn't get away.'
"Like that! We talked as if she were really with me. My life was no longer desolate--the
indifference in my home no longer grieved me. All the interest, the love, the inspiration I had
hungered for, was given to me now by a woman who remained invisible."
Noulens paused again. In the pause I got up to light a cigarette, and-- I shall never forget it--I
saw the bowed figure of his wife beyond the study door! It was only a glimpse I had, but the
glimpse was enough to make my heart stand still--she leant over the table, her face hidden by
her hand.
I tried to warn, to signal to him--he did not see me. I felt that I could do nothing, nothing at all,
without doubling her humiliation by the knowledge that I had witnessed it. If he would only look
at me!
"Listen," he went on rapidly. "I was happy, I was young again--and there was a night when she
said to me, 'It is for the last time.'
"Six words! But for a moment I had no breath, no life, to answer them.
"'Speak!' she cried out. 'You are frightening me!'
"'What has happened?' I stammered. 'Trust me, I implore you!'
"I heard her sobbing--and minutes seemed to pass. It was horrible. I thought my heart would
burst while I shuddered at her sobs--the sobbing of a woman I could not reach.
"'I can tell you nothing,' she said, when she was calmer; 'only that we are speaking together for
the last time.'
"'But why--why? Is it that you are leaving France?'
"'I cannot tell you,' she repeated. 'I have had to swear that to myself.'
"Oh, I raved to her! I was desperate. I tried to wring her name from her then--I besought her to
confess where she was hidden. The space between us frenzied me. It was frightful, it was like a
nightmare, that struggle to tear the truth from a woman whom I could not clasp or see.

"'My dear,' she said, 'there are some things that are beyond human power. They are not merely
difficult, or unwise, or mad--they are impossible. _You_ have begged the impossible of _me_.
You will never hear me again, it is far from likely we shall ever meet--and if one day we do, you
will not even know that it is I. But I love you. I should like to think that you believe it, for I love
you very dearly. Now say good-bye to me. My arms are round your neck, dear heart--I kiss you
on the lips.'
"It was the end. She was lost. A moment before, I had felt her presence in my senses; now I
stood in an empty room, mocked by a futile apparatus. My friend, if you have ever yearned to
see a woman whose whereabouts you did not know--ever exhausted yourself tramping some
district in the hope of finding her--you may realise what I feel; for remember that by comparison
your task was easy--I am even ignorant of this woman's arrondissement and appearance. She
left me helpless. The telephone had given her--the telephone had taken her away. All that
remained to me was the mechanism on a table."
* * * * *
Noulens turned on the couch at last--and, turning, he could not fail to see his wife. I was
spellbound.
"'Mechanism on a table,' he repeated, with a prodigious yawn of relief. 'That is all, my own.'"
"Good!" said madame Noulens cheerily. She bustled in, fluttering pages of shorthand. "But, old
angel, the tale of Paul and Rosamonde is thrown away--it is an extravagance, telling two stories
for the price of one!"
"My treasure, thou knowest I invented it months ago and couldn't make it long enough for it to
be of any use."
"True. Well, we will be liberal, then--we will include it." She noticed my amazement. "What ails
our friend?"
Noulens gave a guffaw. "I fear our friend did not recognize that I was dictating to you. By-thebye, it was fortunate someone rang us up just now--that started my plot for me! Who was it?"
"It was _La Voix_" she laughed, "inquiring if the story would be done in time!"
* * * * *
Yes, indeed, they are comrades!--you are certain to hear it. And as often as I hear it myself, I
think of what he told me that evening--I remember how he took me in.
