Let's assume we have a simple JavaScript/TypeScript class that handles user authentication. Here is an example with added JSDoc comments:

/**
 * Handles user authentication.
 */
class AuthHandler {
  /**
   * Attempts to authenticate the user with the provided credentials.
   *
   * @param {object} data - The user's login data (email and password)
   * @returns {Promise<object|null>} A promise resolving to the authenticated user object, or null if authentication fails
   */
  async attemptLogin(data) {
    // Perform authentication logic here...
    return { userId: 'some-user-id', role: 'admin' };
  }

  /**
   * Handles logging out of the application.
   *
   * @param {object} userData - The user's data (e.g., userId, role)
   * @returns {void}
   */
  async logout(userData) {
    // Clear local storage and reset session state
  }
}

export default AuthHandler;

In this example, we have added JSDoc comments to the `AuthHandler` class and its methods. We've included information about the class's purpose, method parameters and return types, as well as any relevant complex logic or business rules (in this case, the attemptLogin method).
