Since there is no provided code, I will create a simple example of how you might document some code based on the given rules. Let's consider an example of documenting a simple JavaScript class.

/**
 * A simple bank account class.
 *
 * This class represents a basic bank account with methods to deposit and withdraw funds.
 */

class BankAccount {
  /**
   * Creates a new bank account.
   *
   * @param {number} balance - The initial balance in the account (default is 0).
   */
  constructor(balance = 0) {
    this.balance = balance;
  }

  /**
   * Deposits the specified amount into the account.
   *
   * @param {number} amount - The amount to deposit.
   * @returns {void}
   */
  deposit(amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) {
      throw new Error('Deposit amount must be positive.');
    }
    this.balance += amount;
  }

  /**
   * Withdraws the specified amount from the account.
   *
   * @param {number} amount - The amount to withdraw.
   * @returns {void}
   */
  withdraw(amount) {
    if (amount <= 0 || amount > this.balance) {
      throw new Error('Withdrawal amount is invalid.');
    }
    this.balance -= amount;
  }

  /**
   * Gets the current balance in the account.
   *
   * @returns {number} The current balance.
   */
  getBalance() {
    return this.balance;
  }
}

In this example, I've added JSDoc comments to the `BankAccount` class and its methods. I've also included information about the constructor's default value, the deposit and withdrawal methods' validation logic, and the `getBalance` method's return type.

Please note that you can customize this documentation according to your specific requirements and coding style.
