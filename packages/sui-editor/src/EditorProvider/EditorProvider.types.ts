The code you provided appears to be a part of a larger project for creating an editor application. The `EditorReducer` and `EditorReducerBase` functions seem to be responsible for managing the state of the editor.

Here are some observations and suggestions:

1. **Type annotations**: The code uses TypeScript, which is great for maintaining type safety and clarity. However, there are some areas where the type annotations could be improved:
	* In `EditorReducer`, the return type is not specified explicitly.
	* In `EditorReducerBase`, the `state` parameter is inferred as `EditorState`, but it would be better to specify a specific type for the `EditorState`.
2. **Function signature**: The function signatures of `EditorReducer` and `EditorReducerBase` are quite long. Consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable functions.
3. **Variable naming**: Some variable names, such as `stateAction`, could be more descriptive. Consider using longer names to improve readability.
4. **Magic strings**: There are some magic strings scattered throughout the code (e.g., `'DISPLAY_CANVAS'`, `'DISPLAY_SCREENER'`). It would be better to define these as constants or enums to make the code more maintainable.
5. **State updates**: In `EditorReducerBase`, the `state` is updated using the spread operator (`{ ...newState }`). Consider using a more explicit way of updating the state, such as creating a new object with updated properties.

Here's an updated version of the code incorporating some of these suggestions:
export type EditorState = {
  settings: any;
  flags: any;
  // Add other properties that are part of the editor state
};

export function EditorReducer<
  State extends EditorState = EditorState,
  Action extends EditorStateAction = EditorStateAction
>(state: State, action: Action): State {
  const newState = EditorReducerBase(state, action);
  return { ...newState };
}

export function EditorReducerBase(
  state: EditorState,
  action: EditorStateAction,
): EditorState {
  let newState = EditorReducerBaseHelper(state, action);

  // Update the state based on the new state
  const updatedSettings = updateSettings(newState.settings, action);
  const updatedFlags = updateFlags(newState.flags, action);

  return { ...newState, settings: updatedSettings, flags: updatedFlags };
}

function EditorReducerBaseHelper(
  state: EditorState,
  action: EditorStateAction,
): EditorState {
  // Implement the logic for updating the state
  // ...
  return state;
}

function updateSettings(settings: any, action: EditorStateAction): any {
  if (action.type === 'SET_BLEND_MODE') {
    return { ...settings, blendMode: action.payload };
  }
  // Add other cases for updating settings
}

function updateFlags(flags: any, action: EditorStateAction): any {
  if (action.type === 'SET_FLAG') {
    return { ...flags, [action.name]: action.value };
  }
  // Add other cases for updating flags
}
Note that I've introduced some additional functions (`updateSettings` and `updateFlags`) to make the code more modular and easier to maintain. You can adjust these functions according to your specific requirements.
