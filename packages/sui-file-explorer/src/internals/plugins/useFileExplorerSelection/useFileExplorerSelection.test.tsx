This is a test file written in Jest, a popular testing framework for JavaScript. The file contains several test suites that cover different aspects of the `FileExplorer` component.

Here's an overview of the test file:

**Test Suites**

The file has five test suites:

1. **Single selection tests**: These tests verify the behavior of the `FileExplorer` component when selecting a single item.
2. **Multi selection tests**: These tests verify the behavior of the `FileExplorer` component when selecting multiple items.
3. **aria-multiselectable attribute**: These tests verify that the `aria-multiselectable` attribute is set correctly based on whether the component is using single or multi selection mode.
4. **aria-selected item attribute**: These tests verify that the `aria-selected` attribute is set correctly for selected and unselected items, depending on the selection mode.
5. **onItemSelectionToggle prop**: These tests verify that the `onItemSelectionToggle` callback is called when an item is selected or unselected.

**Test Cases**

Each test suite contains several individual test cases. For example:

* In the single selection tests suite, there are two test cases: one for verifying that an unselected item does not have the `aria-selected` attribute set to `true`, and another for verifying that a selected item has the `aria-selected` attribute set to `true`.
* In the multi selection tests suite, there are several test cases for verifying different scenarios, such as when multiple items are selected, when a single item is selected, and when the `disableSelection` prop is set to `true`.

**Example Test Code**

Here's an example of a test case from the single selection tests suite:
```js
it('should have the attribute aria-selected=true if selected', () => {
  const response = render({
    items: [{ id: '1' }, { id: '2' }],
    defaultSelectedItems: ['1'],
  });

  expect(response.getItemRoot('1')).to.have.attribute('aria-selected', 'true');
});
This test case uses the `render` function to create a `FileExplorer` component with two items, and then verifies that the first item has the `aria-selected` attribute set to `true`.

Overall, this test file covers a wide range of scenarios for the `FileExplorer` component, ensuring that it behaves correctly in different selection modes.
