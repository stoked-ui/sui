This is a large codebase that appears to be part of an open-source file explorer. It's written in TypeScript and uses various libraries such as React, Redux, and React Router.

Here are some observations and suggestions:

**Overall Structure**

The code is organized into several files, each with a specific purpose. The main entry point seems to be `index.ts`, which imports and sets up the necessary dependencies. The file explorer's core functionality is implemented in `fileExplorer.ts`.

**Main Features**

1. **File Explorer**: The file explorer provides navigation between directories and files. It uses the Tremaux algorithm to determine the correct order of items in a directory.
2. **Item Management**: The code manages individual files and directories, including their metadata (e.g., name, size, type).
3. **Navigation**: The file explorer allows users to navigate through the directory structure using keyboard or mouse events.

**Improvement Suggestions**

1. **Separate Concerns**: Some functions, like `findOrderInTremauxFileExplorer`, are quite long and complex. Consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable functions.
2. **Type Checking**: While TypeScript is used, there are some places where type checking could be improved (e.g., function return types).
3. **Error Handling**: The code throws errors when encountering invalid ranges or disabled items. Consider using try-catch blocks to handle these exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
4. **Code Duplication**: There's some duplicated code in `getNonDisabledItemsInRange`. Consider extracting a separate function for calculating the next item based on its index.
5. **Performance**: As the file explorer grows, performance may become an issue. Consider implementing caching or lazy loading to improve performance.

**Additional Suggestions**

1. **Consider Using a Library**: The code is implementing some features from scratch (e.g., Tremaux algorithm). If possible, consider using existing libraries or frameworks that can simplify these tasks.
2. **Code Organization**: Some functions are part of a large object (e.g., `fileExplorer`). Consider breaking this down into separate modules or files for better organization and reusability.
3. **Testing**: Writing unit tests and integration tests would help ensure the code's correctness and catch any regressions.

Here's an updated version of the first function with improved type checking and error handling:
export const findOrderInTremauxFileExplorer = (
  instance: FileExplorerInstance<[UseFileExplorerFilesSignature]>,
  itemAId: string,
  itemBId: string,
): [string, string] => {
  if (itemAId === itemBId) return [itemAId, itemBId];

  const itemMetaA = instance.getItemMeta(itemAId);
  const itemMetaB = instance.getItemMeta(itemBId);

  if (!itemMetaA || !itemMetaB) throw new Error('Invalid item IDs');

  if (itemMetaA.parentId === itemMetaB.id || itemMetaB.parentId === itemMetaA.id)
    return itemMetaB.parentId === itemMetaA.id
      ? [itemMetaA.id, itemMetaB.id]
      : [itemMetaB.id, itemMetaA.id];

  const aFamily: (string | null)[] = [itemMetaA.id];
  const bFamily: (string | null)[] = [itemMetaB.id];

  let aAncestor = itemMetaA.parentId;
  let bAncestor = itemMetaB.parentId;

  if (!aFamily.includes(aAncestor)) throw new Error('Invalid ancestor');
  if (!bFamily.includes(bAncestor)) throw new Error('Invalid ancestor');

  while (true) {
    const nextA = getNextItem(instance, aAncestor);
    const nextB = getNextItem(instance, bAncestor);

    if (!nextA || !nextB) break;

    aFamily.push(aAncestor);
    bFamily.push(bAncestor);

    aAncestor = instance.getItemMeta(aAncestor).parentId;
    bAncestor = instance.getItemMeta(bAncestor).parentId;

    if (aAncestor === bAncestor) {
      const commonAncestor = aAncestor;
      const ancestorFamily = instance.getItemOrderedChildrenIds(commonAncestor);

      const aSide = aFamily[aFamily.indexOf(commonAncestor) - 1];
      const bSide = bFamily[bFamily.indexOf(commonAncestor) - 1];

      return [aSide, bSide];
    }
  }

  throw new Error('Invalid range');
};
Note that this is just one possible way to improve the function. There are many other approaches and trade-offs to consider when refactoring code.
